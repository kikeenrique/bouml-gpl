<h3>3.4.1</h3>December, 31th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Default <i>getter</i> and <i>setter</i> definition was wrong
		in Java and C++ when the associated attribute/relation
		produces an array (because of its multiplicity), fixed.<br />
	     Furthermore in this case the <i>setter</i> definition in C++ stops
		to use a <i>memcpy</i>, and now copy the elements one by one.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In the relation dialog the new button <i>association</i>
		allows to create a new class and set the value with it,
		or in case the value is a class to select it in the browser
		(like for the button <i>type</i> in the attribute dialog).

	     <b>Php Generator 1.2.1</b><br />
	     <b>Idl Generator 2.8.2</b><br />
		When a class or an artifact have an empty definition
		the message contained the name of the element without
		its kind, this was disturbing in case the class and
		the artifact have the same name. Now the message
		indicates if the problem concerns the class or the
		artifact.

<h3>3.4</h3>December, 16th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> <font color="red">Previous releases crash when you
		start to draw an association part of the model
		(not an <i>anchor</i> for instance) in a diagram
		and you use one of the buttons allowing to change
		the zoom</font>, fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> It is now possible to ask for to not add the indent dependent
		on the context when the body of an operation is
		produced. This feature is mainly added to simplify the
		work of the reverses and to preserve the original indent
		of the reversed operations.<br />
		By default the indent depend on	the context, this means

	<li> Remark : Bouml is now also available on

<h3>3.3.5</h3>December, 10th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> The stereotype of an attribute was not copied to
		its <i>getter</i> and <i>setter</i>, fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <font color="blue">Now when you create a new project the
		<i>generation settings</i> in Java use <i>generics</i></font>,

		<li> the UML stereotypes <i>list, set</i> and <i>map</i> produce

		</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />


<h3>3.3.2</h3>November, 11th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Add missing relations when you open a diagram having
		the <i>drawing settings 'draw all relations'</i>
		valuing <i>yes</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In a <i>component diagram</i> when you move a containing
		<i>component</i> its nested <i>components</i> which
		intersect with it are also moved.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In a <i>use case diagram</i> when you move a <i>subject</i>
		or a <i>fragment</i> the contained elements are also moved.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> If the element selected in the <i>browser</i> appears in the
		current diagram, the menu of the diagram (called by a right
		mouse click out of any element in the diagram) proposes
		to find the browser element in the diagram, this allows

<h3>3.3.1</h3>November, 5th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> <font color="red">Previous release crashes when you transform
		a sequence diagram containing <i>fragment separator</i>
		to use flat/overlapping <i>activity bars</i></font>, fixed.
		</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />


<h3>3.3</h3>November, 4th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> <font color="red">Previous releases may crash when you ask for replace
		a class instance in a <i>sequence</i> or <i>collaboration diagram</i>
		but there is no available class instance</font>, fixed.<br /><br /></li>
	
	<li> Default <i>getter</i> and <i>setter</i> definition was wrong
		in Java when the corresponding attribute is initialized, fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <i>dependency</i> and C++ :<ul>
		<li> When you edit a <i>dependency</i> just after its creation, the
			C++ definition was shown as <i>#include in source</i> but
			the <i>#include</i> was produced in the header file (supposing
			you don't edit the relation or don't valid the edition), fixed.
			</li>
		<li> In the previous releases, when you created a <i>dependency</i>
			the C++ definition produced the <i>#include</i> in the header file,
			but by default when you edit a relation to be a <i>dependency</i>
			the C++ definition produces the <i>#include</i> in the source file.
			Now, a newly created <i>dependency</i> produces the <i>#include</i>
			in the source file to follow the same rule in all the cases.
			</li>
		</ul><br /></li>

	<li> <i>sequence diagram</i> :<ul>
		<li> Add explicit reflexive return 
			<img src="images/selfreturnmsg_button.png" alt="" border="0" />
			</li>
		<li> Add overlapping <i>activity bars</i>
			<img src="images/overbar.png" alt="" border="0" /> 
			</li>
		<li> By default the newly created <i>sequence diagrams</i>
			use the overlapping <i>activity bars</i>, but
			of course the existing diagrams don't use them.
			</li>
		<li> A diagram using overlapping <i>activity bars</i>
			can be transformed to use flat <i>activity bars</i>,
			and <i>vice versa</i>. The overlapping level introduced
			by a reflexive message is propaged to the next
			messages, you may have to add explicit returns
			before transforming flat <i>activity bars</i>
			to overlapping ones. Known problem : the <i>fragments
			'alt'</i> are not taken into account by the
			transformation,	cutting first the <i>activity bars</i>
			crossing over the separators may help for. The
			transformation is not undoable, to save the project
			before may be a good idea !
			</li>
		<li> in a diagram using overlapping <i>activity bars</i>, the
			reception of a synchronous message create a new 
			overlapping <i>activity bars</i>, this is not the case
			for the reception of an	asynchronous message (but you
			can ask for to create an overlapping <i>activity bars</i>
			through the menu of the message).
			</li>
		<li> in a diagram using overlapping <i>activity bars</i>, 
			a reflexive synchronous messages is always at the
			beginning of an <i>activity bars</i> and a reflexive
			returns at the end, you can't move them.
			</li>
		<li> Like for the previous releases, I prefer to offer a high
			level of flexibility in the construction of the
			<i>sequence diagrams</i>, rather than to limit
			the available modifications or to modify the diagram
			may be by deleting messages in order to always have
			a consistent diagram. To quickly modify a diagram,
			may be to fixe unconsistencies, several facilities are
			available to change the start or end of a message to the
			parent <i>activity bars</i> or a new overlapping
			<i>activity bars</i>, or to collapse an <i>activity bars</i>
			with its parent	<i>activity bar</i>.
			</li>
		</ul><br /></li>

	<li> Add <i>C++/Java/Php roundtrip operation body</i> in the available shortcuts
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Character and background color for texts in diagrams (button <i>abc</i>)
		can be changed. By default a text is written in black and
		doesn't have background (it is transparent).<br />
		Warning : in an SVG export the background color applied
		on all the rectangle sizing the text rather than on the
		background of the characters.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> The color of the character for the notes in diagrams can
		be changed. By default a note is written in black.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,
	     the previous releases of BOUML cannot read a project
	     saved with this version. Obviously this release is
	     able to read the projects made by previous releases of BOUML.</li>

<h3>3.2</h3>October, 21th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> The SVG produced for a <i>component diagram</i>
		contained floating point numbers. Depending on the settings
		associated to your country, the representation of a float can
		uses a ',' rather than a '.', not compatible
		with SVG. Now all the produced numbers are integers.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> It was not possible for a <i>component</i> to require and
