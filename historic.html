<h3>3.0.1</h3>October, 8th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> <font color="red">Previous releases crash during a save</font>,
		fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Php Reverse 1.0.1</b><br />
		The name of the produced artifact contained the 
			reversed file extension, fixed.<br />
		To manage file names containing a dot, ie
		having more than the dot separating the name
		and the extension.
		<br><br></li>

	<li> <b>Java Reverse 2.10.1</b><br />
	     <b>Java Catalog 2.10.1</b><br />
	     <b>C++ Reverse 2.7.1</b><br />
	     <b>Project synchro 1.1.2</b><br />
	     <b>Project control 1.1.1</b><br />
		To manage file names containing a dot, ie
		having more than the dot separating the name
		and the extension.
		</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />
		

<h3>3.0</h3>October, 7th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Add management of <b>PHP 4</b> and <b>5</b><br />
		Currently the scope of PHP is not as large as it is
		for C++ and Java, for instance there is no PHP definitions
		in the state machine and activities because this seems useless.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Now the <i>tabs</i> dedicated to a given language are not shown in the
		dialogs when you don't ask for its management through the
		menu <i>Languages</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Java Reverse 2.10</b><br />
	     <b>Java Catalog 2.10</b><br />
		Since Bouml 2.31.2 the simple inheritances produce <i>realization</i>
			stereotyped <i>bind</i>, fixed.<br />
		Follow the new API.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Php Generator 1.0</b><br />
		New <i>plug-out</i> generating code for PHP.<br />
		To produce definition without visibility compatible
		with PHP 4, remove <i>${visibility}</i> in the
		<i>generation settings</i> and in the definitions
		made before, or set the visibility to <i>package</i>
		at the UML level.<br />
		Refer to the <a href="documentation.html">documentation</a>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Php Reverse 1.0</b><br />
		New <i>plug-out</i> reversing PHP code.<br />
		Refer to the <a href="documentation.html">documentation</a>.<br />
		To test the reverse I applied it on the sources of
		<a href="http://www.joomla.org/" target="_blank">Joomla 1.5RC2</a>,
		this produces almost 600 classes.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Roundtrip body 1.3</b><br />
		To roundtrip Php bodies.<br />
		Follow the new API.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Java Generator 2.12</b><br />
	     <b>C++ Generator 2.9</b><br />
	     <b>C++ Reverse 2.7</b><br />
	     <b>Idl Generator 2.8</b><br />
		Follow the new API.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <i>Plug-out upgrade</i> and the other <i>Plug-outs</i> will
		be upgraded later to manage Php.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />
		

<h3>2.32.1</h3>September, 29th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> To distinguish <i>external</i> and <i>internal self transitions</i>
		(unfortunatelly drawn outside the <i>state</i>),
		the <i>internal self transitions</i> are now drawn with dot lines.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <i>Optimal window size</i> may produces a too small
		window when Bouml is compiled with a Qt 3, fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In the previous releases when an attribute was duplicated
		the multiplicity was not copied, fixed.
		</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />
		

<h3>2.32</h3>September, 23th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> In the previous releases the lines are always drawn
		in the diagrams between the center of their extremities.
		Now it is possible to decenter them to have for instance
		<img src="images/decenter.png" alt="" border="0" />.
		For that do a mouse click
		near the beginning or the end of a line and move the mouse 
		with the click down.<br />
		It is not possible to decenter a line having its geometry
		set through the line menu geometry (
		<img src="doc/figs/linegeo1.png" alt="" border="0" />,
		<img src="doc/figs/linegeo2.png" alt="" border="0" />,
		<img src="doc/figs/linegeo3.png" alt="" border="0" /> or
		<img src="doc/figs/linegeo4.png" alt="" border="0" />).<br />
		When you change the relative position of its extremities,
		a line may go to an other edge like when the line is
		not decenter, but the offset with the top or
		the left of the edge is unchanged.<br />
		Unfortunatelly the angle of a decenter line may change
		when the zoom is modified, because it is not always possible
		to have exactly the desired font size. This is mainly the
		case when the size of the extremities is linked to the font
		size, for instance for classes.<br />
		To come back to a centered drawing, use the submenu 
		<i>Geometry</i> of the line menu and choose <i>recenter begin</i>
		or <i>recenter end</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> It is now possible to add <i>state machines</i> and <i>activities</i>
		under <i>use cases</i> and <i>use case views</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> I consider you have a multiple screens configuration if the desktop width
		is greater than 2000 pixels or two times its height. In this case
		a message box is shown when Bouml starts, speaking about BOUML_LIMIT_DESKTOP.
		To help users having a multiple screen
		configuration whose unfortunatelly don't read the 
		<a href="faq.html#faqother1" target="_blank">FAQ</a> or the
		<a href="doc/index_troubleshots.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>XMI2 Import 1.2.4</b><br />
		To allow <i>state machines</i> and <i>activities</i>
		under <i>use cases</i> and  <i>use case views</i> rather than
		to place them on upper level or dedicated <i>class views</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>State machine generator 1.3.2</b><br />
		To manage <i>state machines</i> under <i>use cases</i> and
		<i>use case views</i>. Because the C++ code generation is not
		made for classes under <i>use case</i> or <i>use case view</i>
		the <i>state machine generator</i> produces an error when it
		is applied on a <i>state machine</i> place in a <i>use cases</i>
		or a <i>use case views</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Plug-out upgrade 1.7.3</b><br />
		To remove <i>${throw}</i> if present in the default
		C++ definition and declaration of the created operations
		(Java operations have exception <i>RuntimeException</i>
		not existing in C++).
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,
	     the previous releases of BOUML cannot read a project
	     saved with this version. Obviously this release is
	     able to read the projects made by previous releases of BOUML.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />
		

<h3>2.31.3</h3>September, 16th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Now, when you add an item to an enumeration
		(class stereotyped <i>enum</i> or <i>enum_pattern</i>),
		the item's type is set to the enumeration. Note : this
		is also done when the item is added by a <i>plug-out</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <i>Plug-outs</i> can't add a <i>flow</i> from an
			<i>expansion node</i>, fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>XMI2 Generator 1.5.3</b><br />
		To produce the type of the enumeration items, even
			if it is not set.<br />
		To produce <i>subvertex</i> rather than <i>connectionPoint</i>
			for the <i>pseudo states</i>.<br />
		To produce <i>transitions</i> out of the <i>regions</i>,
			else Eclipse is not able to import them.<br />
		To add a missing '&gt;' on <i>activity control node</i> export
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>XMI2 Import 1.2.3</b><br />
		To import <i>class instances</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>
	
	<li> <b>Html documentation Generator 2.12.1</b><br />
		Modify produced <i>style.css</i> to indent html page
			contain.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Plug-out upgrade 1.7.2</b><br />
		The first parameter of the operation <i>UmlBaseClassInstance::add_Relation</i>
		is an <i>UmlRelation</i> rather than an <i>UmlAttribute</i>.<br />
		The first parameter of the operation <i>UmlBaseClassInstance::remove_Relation</i>
		is an <i>UmlRelation</i> rather than an <i>UmlAttribute</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <i>Plug-out</i> <b>empty</b><br />
		Upgraded by <i>plug-out upgrade</i>.
		</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />
		

<h3>2.31.2</h3>September, 11th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> <font color="red">Previous releases crash when you open a diagram
		referencing a modeled instance deleted in a previous session
		</font>(this means you didn't open the considered diagram
		after the deletion of the instance in the same session),
		fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <font color="red">Previous releases crash when you edit a read-only
		modeled instance</font>, fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>XMI2 Generator 1.5.2</b><br />
		Modify export of <i>template classes</i> for Uml 2.1
		to allow import by Eclipse.<br />
		When you export for Eclipse, ask for Uml 2.1 export
		and use the file extension <i>xmi</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>XMI2 Import 1.2.2</b><br />
		To be able to import a file produced by the new export for Uml 2.1,
		of course Bouml is able	to import old files.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Reverse 2.6.2</b><br />
	     <b>Java Reverse 2.9.2</b><br />
	     <b>Java Catalog 2.9.1</b><br />
		To create a realization stereotyped <i>bind</i> rather than
		a generalization when a class inherits a template class.
		</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />
		

<h3>2.31.1</h3>September, 2th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Add a button in the IDL tab of the dialog for attributes
		allowing to specify a constant.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Java Reverse 2.9.1</b><br />
		In the previous releases, when the body of an operation
			was not on several lines, this one was directly placed
			in the definition of the operation, without using
			<i>${body}</i>. This optimization is removed because
			this is a problem when you want to generate code with
			<i>preserve operations's body</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.8.3</b><br />
		<i>Text artifacts</i> was generated with an unexpected extention,
		fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>State machine generator 1.3.1</b><br />
		Fixe bug associated to transitions without trigger.<br />
		Instrumented code for the final state was wrong, fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>XMI2 Generator 1.5.1</b><br />
	     <b>XMI2 Import 1.2.1</b><br />
		Fixe management of <i>association classes</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>File Control 1.0.4</b><br />
		Add <i>%dironly</i> corresponding to <i>%dir</i> without
		the <i>drive</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ utilities 1.1.1</b><br />
		To allow to add constructor declared <i>explicit</i>.
		</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />
		

<h3>2.31</h3>August, 26th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> In the previous releases, when you move a state only
		the substates follow. Now the pseudo states and line breaks
		of associated transitions are also moved.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In the previous releases the self transition was
		considered <i>internal</i> (the exit and enter
		behaviors was not executed by the code produced
		by the <i>state machine generator</i>), now editing
		a self transition you can set it <i>external</i>.
		By default a self transition is still <i>internal</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Add the stereotype <i>text</i> for the <i>artifacts</i>.
		An <i>artifact</i> having this stereotype doesn't have
		associated classes nor artifacts, and the code generators
		produce the source definition without any change (there is
		no <i>C++ header</i> for them). The extension of the
		generated file must be specified in the name of the artifact.
		This allows to produce any text file, for instance for
		yacc/bison. In a <i>plug-out</i> the definition depending
		on the language is accessible though the existing operations.<br />
		<font color="#C05800">When you load an <i>artifact</i>
		saved by a previous release of Bouml having the stereotype
		<i>text</i>, this one is replaced by <i>_text</i></font>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>State machine generator 1.3</b><br />
		To manage external self transitions.<br />
		In the class corresponding to the state machine
		all the sub classes are declared <i>friend</i> allowing
		them to access to its protected members. Recall : the
		class instance corresponding to the state machine is 
		given through the operation parameter <i>stm</i>.<br />
		Instrument parts of code using the <i>stdio puts</i>
		function protected by <i>#ifdef VERBOSE_STATE_MACHINE</i>,
		to help you to debug your machine. To add the
		instrumentation you must delete the class(es) realizing
		your state machine made by the previous releases of
		the state machine generator.
		<br /><br /></li>
	
	<li> <b>Html documentation Generator 2.12</b><br />
	     <b>XMI2 Generator 1.5</b><br />
	     <b>XMI2 Import 1.2</b><br />
		To distinguish external and internal self transitions.

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.8.2</b><br />
	    <b>Java Generator 2.11.2</b><br />
	    <b>Idl Generator 2.7.2</b><br />
		To manage <i>text artifacts</i><br />
		To indicate the number of errors and warnings at the end of the trace
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Roundtrip body 1.2.1</b><br />
		To indicate the number of errors and warnings at the end of the trace
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Plug-out upgrade 1.7.1</b><br />
		To add operations <i>isExternal</i>
		and <i>set_isExternal</i> on <i>UmlBaseTransition</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <i>Plug-out</i> <b>empty</b><br />
		Upgraded by <i>plug-out upgrade</i>.

    </ul>
<br /><br />


<h3>2.30.2</h3>August, 12th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> The already opened diagrams was not always updated when
		<i>draw all relation</i> is true and a relation/flow/transition
		is added on an element, fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.8.1</b><br />
	    <b>Java Generator 2.11.1</b><br />
	    <b>Idl Generator 2.7.1</b><br />
		Code generation is not done when a <i>class view</i> contains

	<li> <b>XMI Generator 1.4.5</b><br />
		In the previous releases a nested class was generated
		as an actor, fixed.
		</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />
	

<h3>2.30.1</h3>August, 4th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> <font color="red">Previous releases crash when you duplicated
		a <i>class instance</i> using the <i>marks</i></font>, fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <font color="red">Previous releases crash under Windows 
		because of a C++ compiler bug in <i>optimize speed</i>
		mode, when you ask for some actions through the menu
		of a link between two instances in an object diagram</font>.
		This occured for instance when you changed the geometry
		of the link. Fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Add the entry <i>duplicate</i> in the menu of the
		<i>class instances</i> in the browser. Warning : when an
		instance is duplicated, the value of the attributes are copied
		but the value of the relations are not copied in the new
		instance.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Add the entry <i>geometry</i> in the menu of the link between
		<i>class instances</i> in a collaboration diagram.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ reverse 2.6.1</b><br />
		Several improvements in the management of the namespaces

		</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />
	

<h3>2.30</h3>July, 29th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Sometimes after closing a diagram or dialog the keyboard shortcut

		window, fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> It was not possible to duplicate an attribute through
		a shortcut, fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Add management of the multiplicity for the attributes.<br />
		The <i>generation settings</i> are modified to be able to
		set the default definition of an attribute depending on
		the multiplicity.<br />
		When you load a project, the attributes defined by previous
		releases have an empty multiplicity.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Java Reverse 2.9</b><br />
	    <b>Java Catalog 2.9</b><br />
		When the return value type of an operation was a generic

		To manage attribute multiplicity.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ reverse 2.6</b><br />
		When a directory contains several classes having

	<li> <b>Plug-out upgrade 1.7</b><br />
		Do the following modifications :<ul>
			<li> In the classes <i>CppSettings, IdlSettings</i>

			</ul>
	    	This upgrade is not mandatory : old <i>plug-outs</i>
	    	are compatible with this new releases of BOUML.
	     <br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>.pro Generator 2.1.2</b><br />
		Previous releases don't take into account a generation

    </ul>
<br /><br />
	

<h3>2.29.1</h3>July, 17th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Add new consistency checks when you load a project. Bouml signals
		when several elements share the same internal identifier and how
		it fixe this. This problem may occurs when you change the project
		file by hand or a tool (for instance to merge modifications), or 
		when you don't follow the mandatory rules allowing to use
		Project synchro, or may be an unknown bug in Bouml.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In the previous releases, the <i>browser search</i> 
		<img id="brsearch" src="doc/figs/browsersearch.png" alt="browser search" />
		applyied only on the name of the elements.<br />
		Now you may also search for a string in the documentation of the elements
		or in their declaration/definition/body.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ reverse 2.5.2</b><br />
		In the previous releases you select one directory to reverse it.
		Now you are able to select several directories to reverse them both,
		press 'cancel' in the file dialog to start the reverse of the
		selected directories.<br />
		Recall : all the classes read during the reverse are <u>created</u>
		even if a class having the same name already exist in the model.<br />
		When you select several directories in a reverse, all the classes are
		supposed to be part of the same application.<br />
		So, to reverse the directory <i>d1</i> then to reverse the directory
		<i>d2</i> (two separated reverse) doesn't have the same behavior as
		to reverse <i>d1</i> and <i>d2</i> at the same time (reverse called
		one time, selecting the two directories).
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Plug-out upgrade 1.6.3</b><br />

			<li> <i>UmlParameter</i> become user a classes and
				inherit on the new system classes <i>UmlBaseParameter</i>.</li>
			<li> Add system class <i>UmlBaseView</i> and user class <i>UmlView</i>.
				<i>UmlView</i> inherits <i>UmlBaseView</i> whose inherits <i>UmlItem</i>.
				<i>UmlBaseClassView, UmlBaseComponentView, UmlBaseDeploymentView</i>
				and <i>UmlBaseUseCaseView</i> inherits <i>UmlView</i> rather than
				directly <i>UmlItem</i>.</li>

<h3>2.29</h3>July, 1th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li>  <font color="red">Previous release may crash</font>, fixed.

	<li>  <i>Referenced by</i> management take into account the <i>class instances</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <font color="blue"> Modify the <i>class instance</i> management : don't create
		<i>class instances</i> in the model when you open a <i>sequence diagram</i>
		or <i>collaboration diagram</i>	coming from a release less than 2.28</font>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In a <i>sequence diagram</i> or <i>collaboration diagram</i> it is possible
		to replace a <i>class instances</i> part of the model by a clone not part
		of the model (only graphical). On the opposite it is possible
		to transform an instance to insert it in the model, or to replace it by an
		already existing instance part of the model and having the same type.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Add <i>inner class</i> notation in the class diagrams
		<img id="inner" src="images/inner.png" alt="inner class" />, depending
		on the drawing setting <i>draw all classes relations</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ reverse 2.5.1</b><br />
		To reverse a reference to a class as a relation rather than an attribute.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,

		<br /><br /></li>
	
	<li> Default stereotypes defined for relations between non classes
		was not proposed in edition since release 2.26.2, fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> The <i>template actuals</i> are now written as a label
		attached to a <i>realization</i> in a class diagram.<br />
		Recall : the stereotype <i>bind</i> is not automatically
		set on the realization of a <i>bound</i> class, it is
		your responsability to use it or not.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> New <i>browser</i> element : the <i>class instances</i>
		<img src="doc/figs/classinstance.png" alt="" border="0" />.<br />
		<font color="green">When you open an <i>object diagram</i> coming from a
		previous release, a new <i>class instances</i>
		is created in the view containing the diagram for each drawn instance
		<u>even</u> if a <i>class instances</i> having the same name already exist
		in the same view.<br />
		When you open a <i>sequence diagram</i> or <i>collaboration diagram</i>
		coming from a previous release, a new <i>class instances</i>
		is created in the view containing the diagram for each drawn instance <u>except</u> if a 
		<i>class instances</i> having the same name already exist in the same view.</font><br />
		To create all the <i>class instances</i> you have to open all the diagrams, this is
		done (temporary) when you generate the HTML documentation (however, the
		first HTML code generation may not export all the  <i>class instances</i> even
		all of them are created, depending on the order of the elements).
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> New default stereotypes <i>{complete,disjoint}, {incomplete,disjoint},
		{complete,overlapping}</i> and <i>{incomplete,overlapping}</i>
		for the generalizations (set only when you create a new project).
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> New default stereotype <i>executionEnvironment</i> for the <i>deployment nodes</i>
		(set only when you create a new project).
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Previous releases use a default name when you create a 
		<i>Package</i>, a <i>view</i> or a diagram. Now Bouml
		ask for a name.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Add <i>drawing setting</i> named <i>drawing mode</i> on
		the instances in a sequence diagram, equivalent to
		the same <i>drawing setting</i> already existing on the
		classes in a class diagram.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> The stereotypes of the <i>use case</i> are now
		written in the use case diagrams (except
		the special stereotype <i>realization</i>).
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> It is now possible to unset the <i>preferred size and scale</i>
		for a diagram, to set only the <i>preferred scale</i> and to
		unset it.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> The name substitution of the 'external' classes is now taken
		into account by the dialogs in the previews (<i>Result after
		substitution</i>).
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Idl Generator 2.6.1</b><br />
	     Add the management of the 'external' classes, managing name
		substitutions.
	     	<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Html documentation Generator 2.10</b><br />
		Fixe Java definition of <i>UmlBaseParameterSet.read_uml_()</i>.<br />
		To produce <i>class instances</i>.<br />
		The references to any element, and the name of the files corresponding
		to the diagrams and to the classes (except if <i>-flat</i>) are know
		constant and doesn't change each time you generate the document
		(thanks to the new operation <i>UmlBaseItem::getIdentifier()</i>).<br />
		Follow the new API.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>XMI2 Generator 1.3</b><br />
		Fixe a bug in the generation of <i>expansion region</i>.<br />
		Produce <i>class instances</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Plug-out upgrade 1.6.2</b><br />
		To add <i>class instances</i> management though the new classes
		<i>UmlBaseClassInstance</i> and <i>UmlClassInstance</i>,
		and to add <i>UmlBaseItem::getIdentifier()</i>.<br />
	    	This upgrade is not mandatory : old <i>plug-outs</i>
	    	are compatible with this new releases of BOUML.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <i>Plug-out</i> <b>empty</b><br />
	     Upgraded by <i>plug-out upgrade</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,
	     the previous releases of BOUML cannot read a project
	     saved with this version. Obviously this release is
	     able to read the projects made by previous releases of BOUML.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />


<h3>2.27</h3>May, 29th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>

	<li> New <i>drawing setting</i> named <i>show members stereotype</i>
		allowing to write attribute and operation stereotype in a
		class picture in a class diagram. By default this setting
		is set to false.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,
	     the previous releases of BOUML cannot read a project

    <ul>

	<li> <b>Project synchro 1.1</b><br />
	     Operation bodies and diagrams was not correctly managed, fixed.
		</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />


<h3>2.26.2</h3>May, 20th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> When Bouml was compiled with a Qt 3, the SVG export
		produced fonts with a negative size, fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Add default stereotype <i>import</i> for the <i>dependencies</i>.
		In Java, when a class depend on other classes or a packages and
		these <i>dependency</i> are stereotyped <i>import</i>, the 
		<i>${imports}</i> now produces the corresponding import forms.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Java Generator 2.10.1</b><br />
		A ',' was missing to separate several exceptions after
		<i>throws</i> in the code produced for an
		operation, fixed.<br />
		To replace <i>${imports}</i> by imports forms specified
		by the <i>dependencies</i> stereotyped <i>import</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.7.2</b><br />
		Generation of <i>friend</i> didn't take into account 
		<i>force namespace prefix generation</i>, fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>State machine generator 1.2</b><br />
		Improvement to delete classes, operations and
		attributes produced by a previous state machine
		definition but now useless.<br />
		Warning : if a state or other element is renamed or
		was moved to have a new parent,
		the corresponding class or class member
		is deleted and a new one is created.<br />
		If you add classes or class members, these ones
		will not be deleted by <i>State machine generator</i>
		while their container is not itself deleted, and
		if they don't have a <i>user property</i> named
		<i>STM generated</i> (so,
		don't duplicate elements created by the 
		<i>State machine generator</i> to not have this
		property or remove it after).<br />
		Note : the automatic deletion doesn't apply on 
		elements created by previous releases of the
		<i>State machine generator</i> and not confirmed
		by the new release.<br />
		Follows the new API.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Plug-out upgrade 1.6.1</b><br />
		Add operation <i>UmlbaseItem::deleteIt()</i>
		to delete an element from the model. Doesn't delete
		the associated element in the <i>plug-out</i>
		but this one must <u>not</u> be used anymore.<br />
	    	This upgrade is not mandatory : old <i>plug-outs</i>
	    	are compatible with this new releases of BOUML.

<h3>2.26.1</h3>May, 13th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> In the previous release it was not possible to send
		a message from an existing activity bar, fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Java Reverse 2.8.1</b><br />
		An <i>import java.lang.*;</i> was forced in the artifact
		definition produced by the reverse, 
		it is not any more the case.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.7.1</b><br />
		The code generated for a template class inheriting
		a template class declared <i>external</i> was wrong
		because the actuals was missing. fixed.
		</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />


<h3>2.26</h3>May, 8th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Add constraint on class, operation, attribute and relation.<br />
		Constraints may be shown in a class diagram depending on the
		<i>drawing settings</i> named <i>show information note</i>
		and valuing false by default.<br />
		To limit the needed surface, all the constraints including the
		inherited and the ones of the members are shown in the
		same note attached to the class, rather than to produce a note
		for each constraint. By default all the constraints are shown
		when <i>show information note</i> is true, but you can choose
		which constraint must be visible through the constraint-note
		editor. If <i>show information note</i> is true but there is
		no constraint or you ask for hide them, the constraint-note
		is present but empty.<br />
		Note : you must enter the {} in the constraints
		to respect the UML notation because Bouml is not able to know where
		a constraint start and finish.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <i>${comment}</i> produced comments starting by // in C++.
		Now you may ask for <i>Javadoc</i> style comment
		through the generation settings.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <i>${comment}</i> produced comments starting by // in Java
		when the description used only one line.
		Now you may ask for <i>Javadoc</i> style comment
		through the generation settings in any case, this
		is the default, else the comments use //.<br />
		When you load an old project this setting is set to true.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Now almost all the diagram elements can be connected by <i>anchor</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.7</b><br />
	     <b>Java Generator 2.10</b><br />
		To produce Javadoc style comments depending on generationsettings.
		Follow new API.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Plug-out upgrade 1.6</b><br />
		To upgrade plug-out to manage new generation setting associated to

<h3>2.25.2</h3>May, 1th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> <font color="red">When you edited an operation defined in an enumeration
		(Java specific) and you to toggle <i>abstract</i> or <i>class operation</i>
		Bouml crashed </font>, fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Add Multi pages printing. Now when you ask for print the current
		diagram and you valid the printer choice, a menu appears to allow
		you to choose a print on one, four or nine pages.
		</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.25.1</h3>April, 29th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> The C++ generation setting was set to <i>#include with root relative path</i>
		when you ask for <i>#include with relative path</i>, fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> When a class inherits other class itself nested directly or indirectly
		in template class, it was not possible to set the corresponding
		<i>actuals</i> though the class dialog. This is now possible.<br />
		Known problem : <font color="#C05800">can't manage correctly the case
		of a template class referenced several times in the inheritances</font>
		(for instance <i>class C1 : public C2&lt;int&gt;, public C2&lt;char&gt;::SC2 ...</i>).
		In this case, while this problem is not solved you must replace <i>${type}</i>
		in the generalizations definition by the right definition.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> When the environment variable <i>BOUML_TEMPLATE</i> is defined, the
		project menu propose the entry <i>Create from Template</i>. When you
		select this entry the project specified by <i>BOUML_TEMPLATE</i>
		is load and a <i>save as</i> is automatically done. <i>BOUML_TEMPLATE</i>
		must values the pathname of a project file (a file having the extension <i>prj</i>).
		This help you to create a project where all the settings are set as you want.
		Generally the template project is empty and only defined to set the settings.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Now the size of the font used for the menus and dialogs 
		is the one set through the menu <i>Miscellaneous</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.6.1</b><br />
		When you ask for <i>#include with relative path</i> 
		or <i>#include with root relative path</i> and you #include a header
		file which artifact is placed in a package specifying an absolute
		path for the headers, the relative path to this absolute path was
		produced. Now in this case the absolute path is produced.<br />

		Since the release 2.22, in C++, the template header was not
		produced for the definition of static attributes or relations
		of a template class, when the member has an empty description, fixed.<br />

		To manage inheritances to a class nested directly or indirectly in
		template class. Same problem when a template class is referenced
		several times.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>XMI Generator 1.4.4</b><br />
		A &lt;/UML:Namespace.ownedElement&gt; was missing  in the
		generation of <i>use case</i> dependencies and generalizations,
		fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Java Generator 2.9.1</b><br />
		References to nested classes didn't contain
		container class, fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Java Catalog 2.7.1</b><br />
	     <b>Java Reverse 2.7.1</b><br />
		Improvement to try to produce a relation rather than an attribute
		when a Java attribute's type is a generic form.
		</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.25</h3>April, 22th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> In the previous releases the class dialog had a button to
		specify Java <i>public</i> visibility on class, this one is removed :
		now the Java visibility is the Uml one, like for the operations for
		instance.<br />
		Add visibility on non nested class at UML level (nested classes already
		had visibility).<br />
		<font color="green">When an old project is load</font><ul>
			<li> <font color="green">for the nested classes : 
				if the Java visibility was <i>public</i>
				the Uml visibility is set to <i>public</i>,
				else to <i>package</i>. If the C++ visibility
				followed Uml this one if changed to the desired
				visibility if needed.</font></li>
			<li> <font color="green">for the non nested classes : 
				if the Java visibility was <i>public</i>
				the Uml visibility is set to <i>public</i>,
				else to <i>package</i>.
				</font></li>
			</ul>
		Default class visibility is <i>package</i><br />
		Recall : <i>package</i> visibility is translated to <i>public</i>
		in C++.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In the new project the default class definition in Java
		contains <i>${visibility}</i> rather than <i>${public}</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In the previous releases it was not possible to set the
		multiplicity in the two roles of an undirectional relation.
		This is possible now and of course the two multiplicities
		are visible in a class diagram when there are not empty.
		Note : a <i>plug-out</i> can't access to the second multiplicity
		of an undirectional relation because in this case the
		<i>UmlRelation</i> instance doesn't exist.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Now the C++ <i>generation settings</i> allow to
		ask for auto generated C++ #include relative to
		the root directory (the root directory is specified
		through the last tab of the <i>generation settings</i>).
		I hope four modes to generate #include is enough to
		satisfy everyone !
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> New <i>drawing setting</i> called <i>show parameter name</i>
		allowing to choose to hide or to show the operation parameters name
		when a class is drawn in a class diagram.
		Only active when <i>show classes members full definition</i>
		values yes. Values <i>yes</i> by default at project level and
		<i>default</i> at other levels to be compatible with the previous releases.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Now the <i>drawing setting</i> called <i>show parameter direction</i>
		is also active when the drawing language is UML.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Java Generator 2.9</b><br />
		Previous releases may crash, fixed<br />
		To manage <i>${visibility}</i>, <i>${public}</i> still managed.<br />
		In the previous releases the code generation for an operation
		defined in an <i>@interface</i> stop when a <i>{</i> was reached, 
		still now this is not true when <i>default</i> is written after
		the parameter list, to allow <i>annotation</i> type with a default value
		using {}.<br />

		using {}.<br />
		<font color="green">This allows to reverse all the Java version 6 (update 1) sources
		without warning nor error, producing 9425 classes, 48506 properties

		name only when this class was not in the current namespace. 
		This flag allows you to ask for	namespace generation in all
		the cases. Set to false by default.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> When you create a new project, the default C++ header definition 
		now contains <i>#ifndef ${NAMESPACE}_${NAME}_H</i> and 
		<i>#define ${NAMESPACE}_${NAME}_H</i>, and the default IDL source definition 
		now contains <i>#ifndef ${MODULE}_${NAME}_H</i> and 
		<i>#define ${MODULE}_${NAME}_H</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In a class diagram the role's name of a <i>static</i>
		association is now underlined. 
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.5</b><br />
		To use synonymous classes through namespaces may produced
		incomplete list of class declarations and #include, fixed.<br/>
		To force namespace prefix generation if asked through the
			<i>generation settings</i><br />
		To produce #include with relative pathname if asked through the
			<i>generation settings</i><br />
		In an artifact definition <i>${namespace}</i> is replaced by
		the full namespace where <i>::</i> become _. <i>${NAMESPACE}</i>
		produces the same thing in uppercase. Allows to generate
		<i>#ifdef</i> forms taking the namespace into account.<br />
		Follow the new API.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Idl Generator 2.4</b><br />
		In an artifact definition <i>${module}</i> is replaced by
		the full module where <i>::</i> become _. <i>${MODULE}</i>
		produces the same thing in uppercase. Allows to generate
		<i>#ifdef</i> forms taking the module into account.<br />
		Follow the new API.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Plug-out upgrade 1.4</b><br />
		to upgrade plug-out to manage new <i>generation settings</i>.<br />
	    	This upgrade is not mandatory : old <i>plug-outs</i>
	    	are compatible with this new releases of BOUML.<br />
		Follow the new API.<br />
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ reverse 2.3</b><br />
	     <b>Java Generator 2.8</b><br />
	     <b>Java Catalog 2.6</b><br />
	     <b>Java Reverse 2.6</b><br />
		Follow the new API.		
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <i>Plug-out</i> <b>empty</b><br />
	     Upgraded by <i>plug-out upgrade</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,
	     the previous releases of BOUML cannot read a project
	     saved with this version. Obviously this release is
	     able to read the projects made by previous releases of BOUML.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />


<h3>2.22.2</h3>April, 2th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Since the release 2.22, in C++, the template header was not
		produced for the definition of the operations of a template
		class, when the operation has an empty description, fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.4.7</b><br />
		Fixe the same bug.
		</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />


<h3>2.22.1</h3>April, 1th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> In the previous release the relations may be duplicated
		in the diagrams when you load them, fixed.
		<font color="green">When you load a diagram made or modified
		by the previous release, the redondant relation drawn are
		removed to have only one representation of each relation.</font>
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> It was not possible to add <i>activity</i> and <i>state</i> diagram
		icon in the diagrams, fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In the previous releases it may be not possible to load
		a project when its directory is read-only because
		it is not possible to create the lock directory.
		Now, when the lock directory can't be created but
		don't yet exist, the full project if considered read-only.
		<br /><br /></li>
	
	<li> Add diagram export in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/" target="_blank">SVG 1.1</a>
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Set the focus in one of the text sub-editor when you edit elements.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> When you add a note in a diagram this note is immediatly edited,
			if you cancel the edition the note is still created but without text
			inside.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Improvements on diagram print : set orientation to <i>landscape</i>
			when the diagram's format is a <i>landscape</i> one.
			Memorize parameters <i>color mode, page size</i> and
			full page from a print to the next one in the same session.
			Note : depending on	your printer and your operating system
			this may no work.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li>Classes stereotyped <i>enum_pattern</i> : in the Java 
		definition the attribute <i>value</i> is now declared <i>final</i>
		by default in the <i>generation settings</i> of the new projects.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li>The Java <i>getter</i> and <i>setter</i> operations are now
		named <i>get${Name}</i> and <i>set${Name}</i> by default 
		in the <i>generation settings</i> of the new projects.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Now it possible to unset the association
		of an element with a diagram.<br /><br /></li>

	<li><b>Plug-out API</b><br />
		When the extension of the file name given in parameter to the operation
		<i>UmlBaseDiagram::saveIn</i> is <i>svg</i> the diagram is saved as an SVG
		picture, else a PNG picture.<br />
	    	This upgrade is not mandatory : old <i>plug-outs</i>
	    	are compatible with this new releases of BOUML.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Html documentation Generator 2.6.3</b><br />
		To allow to produce SVG files rather than PNG ones, using the
		new option <i>-svg</i><br />
		In the new projects the HTML production using SVG is added in the tools list,
		you may modify the settings of the old projects to add this option.<br />
	     The HTML now accept the following arguments (in order) :<ul>
		<li> <i>-flat</i>, optional, to produce the class definitions in
			<i>index.html</i> rather than in separate files.</li>
		<li> <i>-svg</i>, optional, to produce SVG pictures rather than PNG ones.</li>
		<li> <i>generated Html files directory</i> (must not contains space)
			mandatory if the next arguments are given (except the port
			number given by BOUML itself)</li>
		<li> <i>-del_html</i>, optional, to remove already existing HTML files
			in the specified directory</li>
		<li> <i>-del_css</i>, optional, to replace the file <i>style.css</i>
			if it already exists in the specified directory, do not
			use this option if you have your own styles.
			Of course in all the cases <i>style.css</i> is created
	 	 	if it doesn't exist</li>
	     </ul>
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Idl Generator 2.3.3</b><br />
		A ';' was missing at the end of <i>module</i> definition, fixed.
		</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />


<h3>2.22</h3>March, 10th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Previous releases allow to define an association from a source artifact
		(artifact stereotyped <i>source</i>) to another artifact and forbid to do
		that from a non source artifact. This was wrong, the goal is to define
		association from a non source artifact to another artifact, not the
		reverse. Fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> New toggle <i>add operation profile on body edition</i> in the
		menu <i>miscellaneous</i>, it is exclusive with
		<i>preserve operations's body</i>, and not set by default.
		When you edit an operation's body and this toggle is set, 
		the C++ or Java operation's definition you see behind
		<i>result after substitution</i> in the operation
		dialog is added before the operation body. This allows you to
		know which operation is edited and to see the operation profile.
		Of course the added header is removed when the (may be) new operation's
		body is taken into account.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> New <i>drawing setting</i> called <i>show parameter direction</i>
		allowing to choose to hide or to show the operation parameters
		direction and default value when a class is drawn in a class diagram.
		Only active when <i>show classes members full definition</i>
		values yes and when the drawing language is UML. Values <i>yes</i>
		by default at project level and <i>default</i> at other levels
		to be compatible with the previous releases.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Modification of the <i>drawing setting</i> called <i>draw all classes relations</i> :<br />
		<ul>
			<li> in the previous releases it concerned only the relations between classes
				in a class diagram, now it applies on relations between any element
				in any diagram. </li>
			<li> in the previous releases it was possible to set this settings at class
				level, this means for a given class drawing. This is not possible anymore.
				To don't disturb old class diagrams, when a class has this setting set to <i>no</i>
				this setting is forced to <i>no</i> at diagram level.
				To don't disturb old other diagrams, this setting is forced to <i>no</i>
				for them.</li>
			<li> of course it is renamed <i>draw all relations</i>.</li>
		</ul><br /></li>


	<li> The <i>getter</i> and <i>setter</i> operations was updated each time
		the edition of the corresponding attribute or relation was confirmed.
		It is now possible to freeze their definition through a check box added
		in the C++, Java and IDL tab of the <i>getter</i> and <i>setter</i> operation
		dialog. By default their are not frozen to be compatible with previous
		releases.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In the <i>generation settings</i> it is now possible to ask for
		a C++ <i>setter</i> operation to receive its argument by reference.
		By default the argument is still given by value to be compatible with
		previous releases.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In the previous releases the generation directories specified in the
		<i>generation settings</i> was to be absolute. It is now possible to
		enter relative paths, relative to the project path.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>MacOS X for intel</b> : in the previous release the dot lines
		was not drawn correctly, fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.4.6</b><br />
		In the previous releases the description of a static attribute was only
		generated for the attribute declaration but not for its definition, done.<br />
		To generate the <i>template</i> header of an operation definition
		or a static relation definition after the description associated to
		<i>${comment}</i> or <i>${description}</i> rather than before.<br />
		To manage relative path in the <i>generation settings</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Java Generator 2.7.3</b><br />
	     <b>Idl Generator 2.3.2</b><br />
		To manage relative path in the <i>generation settings</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>XMI2 Import 1.0.1</b><br />
	     Little modifications to be less strict and import files produced
		by more tools.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Plug-out upgrade 1.3.5</b><br />
		to upgrade plug-out to manage new <i>drawing setting show parameter direction</i>
		and new <i>getter</i> and <i>setter</i> properties.<br />
	    	This upgrade is not mandatory : old <i>plug-outs</i>
	    	are compatible with this new releases of BOUML.		
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <i>Plug-out</i> <b>empty</b><br />
	     Upgraded by <i>plug-out upgrade</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,
	     the previous releases of BOUML cannot read a project
	     saved with this version. Obviously this release is
	     able to read the projects made by previous releases of BOUML.</li>

    </ul>

<br /><br />


<h3>2.21.7</h3>March, 3th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Previous release doesn't allow to have project's name
		containing dots, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> It was not possible to add <i>generalization</i> or
		<i>dependency</i> in a <i>package</i> through a
		<i>plug-out</i>, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> To use the
		buttons <img id="left" src="images/left.png" alt="left button" />
		or <img id="right" src="images/right.png" alt="right button" />
		before loading a projet crash Bouml, fixed.
		Remark  : these buttons are usefull only after loading a
		project	and the selection of at least two elements in
		the <i>browser</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Information, warning and critical message boxes
		are now placed taken into account the optional screen
		subpart	specified by the environment variable
		<i>BOUML_LIMIT_DESKTOP</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>XMI2 Import 1.0</b><br />
	     New <i>plug-out</i>, must be applied on a package,
		or the project.<br />
		Allows to import an XMI 2.1 file for UML 2.0 or 2.1,
		please refer to the
		<a href="http://bouml.free.fr/doc/index_xmiimport.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>.<br />
		This <i>plug-out</i> is configured by default
		in the new projects. The name of the executable to
		add it to the <i>plug-outs</i> list of the existing
		projects is <i>ixmi2</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.4.5</b><br />
	     <b>Java Generator 2.7.2</b><br />
	     <b>Idl Generator 2.3.1</b><br />
		Previous releases rewrite unnecessarily the files
		containing at least a character of code &gt; 127, fixed.<br />
		Error messages are written in red.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>XMI2 Generator 1.2</b><br />
		Add generation of association classes.<br />
		Modify the generation of a trigger associated to an <i>activity accept event action</i>.<br />
		Modify the generation of a signal associated to an <i>activity send signal action</i>
		and <i>activity broadcast signal action</i>.<br />
		The transition's name was not generated, fixed.</li>
    </ul>

<br /><br />


<h3>2.21.6</h3>February, 18th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> When you edited a relation drawn from a non read-only class to a read-only class,
		the kind of the relation indicated in the dialog was wrong, fixed.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> The name of a directory containing a project must be equal to the
		project's name. Produces a dedicated message when you try to open
		a project whose doesn't follow this rule.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Add an historic of the selected elements in the <i>browser</i>,
		navigation is done through the
		buttons <img id="left2" src="images/left.png" alt="left button" />
		and <img id="right2" src="images/right.png" alt="right button" />.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>XMI2 Generator 1.1</b><br />
		<i>uml:</i> was missing before the activity node type, the deployment
			node and the artifact,
			in forms <i>xmi:type="uml:&lt;the type&gt;"</i>, fixed.<br />
		Modify the generation of the default value of a formal parameter</li>

    </ul>

<br /><br />


<h3>2.21.5</h3>February, 5th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> <font color="red">Bouml crashed when you edit a class having
		a dependency to a <i>package</i></font>, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <font color="red">Management of deleted but still referenced
		objects was not always done when a project was loaded
		 and may produced a crash</font>,
		fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In an operation declaration, <i>${class}</i> was not
		substituted by the class's name, this is done now. Because
		<i>${class}</i> is normally not used in an operation
		declaration, the goal is probably to place it in the
		documentation.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In the previous releases a <i>dependency</i> not
		stereotyped <i>friend</i> produced an <i>#include</i>
		in the header file in C++. Now you are able to choose
		where the <i>#include</i> must be generated, and the default
		is now in the source file. Of course the already existing
		<i>dependencies</i> continue tu produce the <i>#include</i> in
		the header file while you don't modify them.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In the previous releases when a class <i>A</i> was duplicated to
		the class <i>B</i> only the constructor and destructor operations
		was renamed to use <i>B</i> rather than <i>A</i>.
		Now the operations and attributes are also modified
		to replace the <u>references</u> of <i>A</i> to <i>B</i> (
		the texts containing <i>A</i> are unchanged, for
		instance an <i>attribute</i> of type <i>A&amp;</i>
		and the body of the operations are unchanged).
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.4.4</b><br />
		To substitute <i>${class}</i> by the class's name
		in an operation declaration.<br />
		Improvement in the computing of the type dependency
		used to generate declaration and  <i>#include</i>.<br />
		To follow the new rule concerning the <i>dependencies</i>
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Reverse 2.2.6</b><br />
		Forms like <i>typedef class C1 {...} C2;</i> and
		<i>typedef struct S1 S2;</i> was not reversed, done.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>XMI2 Generator 1.0.1</b><br />
		Generates <i>xmi:version</i> rather than <i>xmi.version</i>,
		<i>xmi:idref</i> rather than <i>xmi.idref</i> and
		<i>xmi:id</i> rather than <i>xmi.id</i>.</li>

    </ul>

<br /><br />


<h3>2.21.4</h3>January, 29th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> <b>C++ Reverse 2.2.5</b><br />
		When an enumeration item having a specified value was reversed
		the '=' was missing in the corresponding attribute default value,
		fixed.<br />
		Complete fixing of operation parameter default value
		(previous fixing work only for inline operations defined
		inside their class).</li>
    </ul>

<br /><br />


<h3>2.21.3</h3>January, 28th 2007<br /><br />
    <ul>

	<li> it was not possible to read a project containing a <i>send signal</i>
		or <i>broadcast signal activity action</i> with a non empty signal
		specified in the Ocl tab (produced the error message
		<font color="red">'end' expected rather than 'uml'</font>),
		fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> It was not possible to edit the body of an <i>operator</i> '/' or '/='
		using the external editor specified through BOUML_EDITOR under
		Linux because I didn't replace the '/'. Now the special characters
		are replaced by '_' not only for Windows.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Project synchro 1.1</b><br />
	     <b>Project control 1.1</b><br />
		The revision of the project files not created nor modified by a release
		of Bouml greater or equal than 2.21 is now 0 rather than 1.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Reverse 2.2.4</b><br />
		When an operation's parameter has a default value 
		the UML parameter definition in Bouml contains this
		default value but it was not inserted in the C++
		definition, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>XMI2 Generator 1.0</b><br />
	     New <i>plug-out</i>, must be applied on the project.<br />
		To produce XMI 2.1 for UML 2.0 or 2.1, please refer to the
		<a href="http://bouml.free.fr/doc/index_xmigenerator.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>.<br />
		Note : the old XMI 1.2 generator is still present.<br />
		This <i>plug-out</i> is configured by default
		in the new projects. The name of the executable to
		add it to the <i>plug-outs</i> list of the existing
		projects is <i>gxmi2</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Plug-out upgrade 1.3.4</b><br />
		Add the missing operations <i>isStream</i> and

    </ul>

<br /><br />

<h3>2.21.1</h3>December, 27th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li>Add buttons <i>ok</i> and <i>cancel</i> in the dialog of the 
		<i>note</i> and <i>text</i>, mainly to help MacOS X users
		because under this OS the dialog sub window doesn't propose
		a way to close it.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Project synchro 1.0</b><br />
		This new tool is not a <i>plug-out</i>, the
		executable named <i>projectSynchro</i> (with or without
		an extension depending on the operating system) is
		installed with BOUML.<br />
		This tool helps several persons to work on the same
		project when they don't access to the same shared project
		files, in case each user has his own copy of these files
		and works only on this copy. 
		The tool automatizes the copy of the right files
		from an image of the project into an other one using
		the revision numbers. The project files are <u>not</u>
		merged, a given project file is supposed not modified
		by several users, for instance thanks to the use
		of <i>project control</i>. Because the tool use the revision,
		it is not possible to use it to synchronize projects modified
		by the previous releases of Bouml. Warning, if <u>all</u> the previous
		conditions are not followed, the tool must <u>not</u> be used, else
		the result is hazardeous.<br />
		Refer to the
		<a href="http://bouml.free.fr/doc/index_projectsynchro.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>,
		the chapter <a href="http://bouml.free.fr/doc/index_multiuser.html" target="_blank">multi users considerations</a>
		is also updated.
		</li>
    </ul>

<br /><br />

<h3>2.21</h3>December, 17th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Modifications to help several persons to work on the same project :<br />
		<ul>
		<li> A revision number and the BOUML_ID and name of the person
			doing the last modification are now saved in the file
			associated to the package.
			Note : the revision doesn't grow each time a
			package file is	saved, the number saved is the
			value of the revision when the file was read more one.
			</li>

		<li> When you are the owner of a package (see <i>Project control</i>)
			and you add to it a new sub-package, Bouml proposes you
			to be the owner of this new sub-package.</li>

		<li> A project under the control or <i>Project control</i> or
			<i>Project synchro</i> is opened in read-only mode
			by Bouml (a message warns you).<br /><br /></li>

		<li> <b>Project control 1.0</b><br />
			This new tool is not a <i>plug-out</i>, the
			executable named <i>projectControl</i> (with or without
			an extension depending on the operating system) is
			installed with BOUML.<br />
			This tool helps several persons to work on the same
			project by choosing who is able to modify a given
			<i>package</i> and its elements. Project control is
			usefull when you don't use a file control to modify
			the write permission of the project files. Please, refer to the
			<a href="http://bouml.free.fr/doc/index_projectcontrol.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>.
			<br />
			Note : a second tool named <i>project synchro</i> coming soon
			will allows to synchronize a project developed in 
			parallel by several persons.<br /></li>

		</ul><br /></li>

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,
	     the previous releases of BOUML cannot read a project
	     saved with this version. Obviously this release is
	     able to read the projects made by previous releases of BOUML.</li>
    </ul>

<br /><br />

<h3>2.20</h3>December, 10th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> In the previous releases, when you set the <i>individual
		attribute visibility</i> or <i>individual operation visibility</i>
		for a class in a <i>class diagram</i>, you indicated which members
		must be hidden. This means that when you add a member, it was visible.
		Now the dialog allows you to choose to set the visible or
		hidden members list.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> It is now possible to add separators in the <i>fragments</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> it was already not possible to draw several times an <i>activity, activity action,
		activity node, activity object, activity region, state</i> or
		<i>pseudo state</i> in a diagram, now it is not possible to paste
		these elements when they are already drawn.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Modify the shortcut dialog to take into account
		the Mac specificities : the <i>control</i> key is
		replaced by the key <img src="doc/figs/pomme.png" alt="" border="0" />,
		and the <i>alt</i> key is sometimes named <i>option</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,
	     the previous releases of BOUML cannot read a project
	     saved with this version. Obviously this release is
	     able to read the projects made by previous releases of BOUML.</li>
    </ul>

<br /><br />

<h3>2.19.5</h3>December, 3th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Complete shortcut management not yet done for some graphical
		elements.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In the previous releases, the trace sub window is
		shown and raise each time something is added
		by a <i>plug-out</i> by calling	<i>UmlCom::trace()</i>
		operation. Now this is not mandatory, and two
		<i>UmlCom</i> static operations are added :<ul>
			<li><i>void showTrace()</i> : to show and raise the
				trace sub window</li>
			<li><i>void traceAutoRaise(bool y)</i> :
				if <i>y</i> is true, the next times
				<i>trace()</i> will be called the
				trace sub window will be automatically
				shown and raised if needed.
				if <i>y</i> is false, the trace sub
				window will not be forced to be
				visible</li>

	<li> By default to hit a <i>return</i> in the <i>browser</i> call
		the menu of the selected <i>browser</i> item, so
		is similar to a right mouse click done on the selected

		made in the <i>browser</i> it is necessary to first
		activate it through a mouse click. Recall : the arrows
		allows to navigate through the browser, or through
		a menu.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> The shortcut for the <i>C++ code generation</i> is now
		<i>Control-g</i> to avoid conflict with the shortcut
		for <i>copy</i> in a diagram (<i>Control-c</i>).<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Now, by default the key <i>Suppr</i> has no
		effect in the <i>browser</i>, to delete an element
		hit <i>Control-d</i>.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> The following shortcuts are removed :<ul>
		<li><i>Control-n</i> (new project), hit <i>Alt-p</i> then <i>n</i></li>
		<li><i>Control-o</i> (open project), hit <i>Alt-p</i> then <i>o</i></li>
		<li><i>Control-w</i> (close project), hit <i>Alt-p</i> then <i>w</i></li>
		<li><i>Control-q</i> (quit), hit <i>Alt-p</i> then <i>q</i></li>
		<li><i>Control-t</i> (show trace window), hit <i>Alt-t</i> then <i>t</i></li>
		</ul><br /></li>

	<li> The entry <i>Edit shortcuts</i> in the menu
		<i>Miscellaneous</i> allows to edit the shortcuts.
		A shortcut applies on the selected element in the
		browser or the elements in the the diagram
		sub-windows. The shortcuts allow to execute a
		command available through a menu (like <i>New operation</i>)
		or to run a <i>plug-out</i> (for that you must
		enter the display string associated to the <i>plug-out</i>
		in the second tab of the shortcut editor).
		The commands are similar to the menu entries,
		edits the shortcuts to see them.<br />
		The shortucuts are saved in the file 
		<i>.bouml_shortcuts_&lt;BOUML_ID&gt;</i>
		where <i>&lt;BOUML_ID&gt;</i> is replaced by its value,
		this file is located in the <i>home directory</i> and
		is created when you validate the shortcut edition.

<h3>2.19.2</h3>November, 12th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> <b>Global change 1.0</b><br />
	     New <i>plug-out</i>, must be applied on the project, or
		a <i>package, class view, deployment view</i> or an <i>Operation</i>.<br />
	     Allows to do global modification of the <i>artifact, classes, operations, attributes</i>
		and <i>relations</i> definitions, working recursively from the <i>browser</i> element
		on which it is applied.
		May be used to propagate a change done on the <i>generation settings</i> to the
			already existing elements.
		See <a href="doc/index_globalchange.html" target = "_blank">Global change</a>.<br />
	     This <i>plug-out</i> is automatically configured on the
	     new project, to use it in your already existing project :
	     the name of the executable is <i>global_change</i>, and
	     the targets are the project, the <i>package, class view, deployment view</i> and
		<i>Operation</i>.</li>

<h3>2.19.1</h3>November, 6th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Bouml produced an error message
		(like <font color="red">public//activity is not a visibility</font>)
		when it read a project
		where a <i>class view</i> has a <i>class setting</i> set
		to a value different than <i>default</i>.
		This bug introduced in release 2.17 is fixed.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.19</h3>November, 5th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Adds toggle <i>preserve operations's body</i> in the
		<i>Miscellaneous</i> menu, see code generation below.<br /><br /></li>
	     
	<li> Adds new colors.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.4</b><br />
	     <b>Java Generator 2.7</b><br />
	     If the toggle <i>preserve operations's body</i> is set,
		the generators do not modify the body of the operations
		protected by dedicated delimiters. This means that for them
		the body definition set through BOUML is not used.<br />
	     The first time you generate the code  with the toggle set,
		because the delimiters are not yet present in the
		generated code, the operations's body will be updated
		depending on their definition under BOUML.<br />
	     After, while the toggle is set and the delimiters present,
		the bodies will not change, allowing you to modify them
		out of BOUML.<br />
	     Notes : <ul>
		<li> In case the file containing a body definition is
			not consistent with the <i>artifact</i> under
			BOUML, the body will be regenerated by the code
			generation, using its definition under the model.<br />
			Of course in C++ an operations
			becoming <i>inline</i> or stopping to be
			<i>inline</i> is not a problem.</li>
		<li> When you <i>import</i> a project, the body of
			the imported operations must be the right one
			in the imported model. The preserved bodies
			of the imported operations will not be find
			because the identifier of an operation used
			to mark its body changes during the import.</li>
		<li> The bodies under the model are <u>not</u> updated
			by the code generation (a new <i>plug-out</i>
			must be made for that).</li>
		<li> Only the operations using the keyword
			<i>${body}</i> may have a preserved body.</li>
		<li> The only modification you can do in the lines
			containing the delimiters is the indent.</li>
		<li> The toggle is saved in the file associated to
			the project, be sure the save is done when you
			change this toggle !</li>
	     </ul><br /><br /></li>

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,
	     the previous releases of BOUML cannot read a project
	     saved with this version. Obviously this release is
	     able to read the projects made by previous releases of BOUML.</li>

	<li> The position of the <i>required</i> or <i>provided interface</i>'s
		name in a <i>component diagram</i> was not saved, resetting
		their position when a diagram is reopen, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Modify the <i>tools dialog</i> to allow to attach a <i>plug-out</i>
		on any <i>browser</i> element.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> The operation's menu in the <i>browser</i> proposes to directly
		edit the C++ and/or Java body when the corresponding operation's
		definition contains the keyword <i>${body}</i>.<br /><br /></li>


	<li> <b>Java Catalog 2.5.3</b><br />
	     <i>JavaCatWindow::windows_style()</i> was not compilable
		when <i>Qt</i> doesn't manage the <i>windows</i> style,

<h3>2.17.2</h3>October, 15th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> It is now not possible to draw two times the same <i>state</i> or
		<i>pseudo state</i> in a <i>state diagram</i> (but the

	<li> The description of the relations is now show/editable in the bottom right
		sub windows like for the other browser elements. Note : concern only
		the role 'a' of a bidirectional relation, to see/edit the documentation
		of the role 'b' you have to edit the relation.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Now two <i>activity object nodes</i> may have the same name
		in the <i>browser</i> because an <i>activity object nodes</i>
		is in fact a <u>use</u> of an <i>activity object</i> where you are able
		to specify its <i>state</i>.<br /><br /></li>

	later.<br /><br /></li>
	<li> In the previous releases a transition <i>trigger,
	guard</i> and <i>activity</i> was not shown in a
	<i>state diagram</i> while the transition had a name.
	The new <i>drawing setting</i> named <i>show transition
	definition</i> valuing <i>false</i> by default allows
	to choose between the name and the definition.

	<li> When the class of a class instance is specified the menu
		of the class instance in a diagram (for instance a
		<i>sequence diagram</i>) has the entry <i>select class
		in browser</i><br /><br /></li>

	<li> When the message in a <i>sequence diagram</i> is an

		A <i>package</i> may now depend on a <i>component</i>
		or an <i>artifact</i> (the reverse <i>dependencies</i>
		was already possible).<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In an <i>attribute</i> dialog the label <i>type :</i>

    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.15.4</h3>July, 2th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Fixe the drawing of a <i>node</i> in a <i>deployment
	diagram</i> to write first the optional <i>stereotype</i>.
	<br /><br /></li>

	<li> To allow to define default stereotypes using
	non ISO_8859-1 (<i>latin1</i>) characters
	<br /><br /></li>

	<li> The dialog tab <i>User</i> is renamed <i>Properties</i>,
	recall : it allows to set <i>tagged values</i>.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.15.3</h3>June, 26th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> In the previous releases, when you enter non ISO_8859-1
	     (<i>latin1</i>) characters in a dialog or documentation
	     part, these ones was replaced on <i>ok</i> by a space
	     because of a conversion from 16 bits <i>Unicode</i> to
	     8 bits <i>latin1</i> character.<br />
	     Now you may specify how to do the conversion (still to a
	     8 bits character) through the environment variable
	     <i>BOUML_CHARSET</i>.<br />
	     When this variable is undefined or
	     has an empty value, the character set is ISO_8859-1.
	     If its value is not a known character set's name, 
	     a dialog appears when you start BOUML giving the available
	     names. So, to know the possible character sets, set
	     <i>BOUML_CHARSET</i> to <i>wrong</i> for instance and call
	     BOUML.<br />
	     Examples (the list depends on the release of Qt) :<ul>
		<li><i>ISO_8859-1</i> (latin1) for English, French, Italien, German ...</li>
		<li><i>ISO_8859-7</i> for Greek</li>
		<li><i>KOI8-R</i> or <i>KOI8-RU</i> or <i>CP_1251</i> to allow Cyrillic</li>
		<li><i>JIS7</i> for Japan</li>
		</ul>
	     The specified encoding is used for :<ul>
		<li> the description of every elements,</li>
		<li> the <i>user keywords</i> and associate values of every elements,</li>
		<li> the stereotype of every elements,</li>
		<li> the definition of the <i>artifacts, classes,
			operations, attributes, relations</i> and
			<i>extra members</i>,</li>
		<li> the <i>state action</i> behavior</li>
		<li> the <i>state</i> entry / exit / do behavior</li>
		<li> the <i>transition</i> trigger / guard / do behavior</li>
		<li> the <i>notes</i> and <i>text</i> in the diagrams</li>
		</ul>
	     It is not used else where, for instance you can't use non ISO_8859-1
	     characters to name the elements or in a message of a 
	     sequence or collaboration diagram.<br />
	     The specified encoding is followed in the project's
	     files and for the exchanges with the <i>plug-out</i>,
	     this means for instance that <i>Cyrillic</i> characters
	     may be used in the comments and are generated unchanged
	     by the code generators.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Html documentation Generator 2.5.3</b><br />
		To be compatible with non ISO_8859-1 character sets,
		remove the special management of accentued characters,
		for instance the character '&eacute;' is generated
	        unchanged rather than replaced by '&amp;eacute;'<br />
		The information specified through the <i>plug-out use
		case wizard</i> are now produced.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Use case wizard 1.1 (C++ version)</b><br />
		To manage non ISO_8859-1 character sets, get the desired
		encoding through the environment variable <i>BOUML_CHARSET</i>.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.15.2</h3>June, 18th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Add the sub menu <i>edit</i> in the menu <i>Project</i> to edit 
	     the generation settings, default stereotypes,
	     class settings at the project level, and drawing settings at
	     the project level.<br /><br /></li>
	<li> It is now possible to give arguments to the <i>plug-out</i>
	     executed when BOUML is started. These arguments are given after
	     the <i>plug-out</i> specification and before the optional
	     <i>-exit</i> whose must be the last parameter of
	     BOUML if present.<br />
	     For instance :<ul>
		<li><i>"C:\Program Files\Bouml\bouml" "D:\...\aze\aze.prj" -exec C:\Progra~1\Bouml\gxmi -uml c:\aze.xmi windows-1252 -exit</i></li>
		<li><i>bouml .../qsd/qsd.prj -exec -flat /usr/lib/bouml/ghtml /tmp/qsd_html -del_html -exit</i></li>
	     </ul>
	     <br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Html documentation Generator 2.5.2</b><br />
	     Now use a <i>css</i> file to define used styles, allowing you to
		modify them<br />
	     Classes descriptions was produced in separated files, now
	     	you may ask to produce them in <i>index.html</i>, helping
		to print the result or produce a <i>pdf</i> file,
		see <i>-flat</i> below. Now when you create a new project
		by default the two ways	are set in the <i>Tools settings</i>,
		you may modify the settings of the old projects to add this option.<br />
	     Accept the following arguments (in order) :<ul>
		<li> <i>-flat</i>, optional, to produce the class definitions in
			<i>index.html</i> rather than in separate files.</li>
		<li> <i>generated Html files directory</i> (must not contains space)
			mandatory if the next arguments are given (except the port
			number given by BOUML itself)</li>
		<li> <i>-del_html</i>, optional, to remove already existing HTML files
			in the specified directory</li>
		<li> <i>-del_css</i>, optional, to replace the file <i>style.css</i>
			if it already exists in the specified directory, do not
			use this option if you have your own styles.
			Of course in all the cases <i>style.css</i> is created
	 	 	if it doesn't exist</li>
	     </ul>
	     In case the <i>generated files directory</i> is specified the dialogs don't
	     appears, this allows to generate the HTML documentation
	     without any manual action.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>XMI Generator 1.4.1</b><br />
	     Accept the following arguments (in order) :<ul>
		<li> <i>-uml</i> or <i>-c++</i> or <i>-java</i><br />
			to specify the target language, mandatory
			if other arguments are given (except the port
			number given by BOUML itself)</li>
		<li> generated XMI file path (must not contains space)</li>
		<li> encoding, for instance <i>windows-1252</i></li>
		<li> <i>-view</i>, optional, to generate views as package</li>
		<li> <i>-simpleTv</i> to generate <i>tagged values</i>
			with the simple form, <i>-complexTv</i> to generate <i>tagged values</i>
			with the complex form, else the <i>tagged values</i>

<h3>2.15.1</h3>June, 11th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> <font color="red">Since the 2.14.5 the modification of a relation
	     between classes shown in a class diagram produces an infinite loop if the line
	     is segmented</font>, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Generalize the management in the diagrams of the self-relations from
	     the classes to the packages, components etc ..., i.e. to move the self
	     relations with the object, to automatically add two break line points
	     when you draw a self relation.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> To follows the norme : when you ask to hide class's attributes or operations
	     through to the <i>drawing setting "hide attributes"</i> or
	     <i>"hide operations"</i> the corresponding separators are not drawn.<br />
	     If you hide attributes / operations individualy the separators are drawn
	     even if you hide all the attributes / operations.<br />
	     The computing of the size of a class in a class diagram is unchanged
	     (space taken by a hidden separator is still present) to not deteriorate
	     the vertical alignments of the classes in your already existing diagrams.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Java Catalog 2.5.2</b><br />
	     <b>Java Reverse 2.5.2</b><br />
	     Since the 2.14 the visibility is not set for the reversed operations and
	     relations, fixed.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

 
<h3>2.15</h3>June, 4th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> It is now possible to apply a <i>plug-out</i> <u>on the project</u>
	     when BOUML is started :<ul>
		<li><i>bouml &lt;project file&gt; -exec &lt;plug out&gt; -exit</i></li>

		<li><i>&lt;project file&gt;</i> indicates the model to load as usual.</li>

		<li><i>&lt;plug out&gt;</i> indicates the <i>plug-out</i> to apply
	 	on the project.	The C++ generator is named <i>cpp_generator</i>,
		the Java generator <i>java_generator</i>, the Idl generator
		<i>idl_generator</i>, the HTML generator <i>ghtml</i>, the XMI
		generator <i>gxmi</i>. If necessary the full path of the <i>plug-out</i>
		have to be done, warning : under Windows this path must <u>not</u>
		contain space.</li>

		<li><i>-exit</i> is optional and allows to exit from BOUML when the
		<i>plug-out</i> execution is done.</li>
	     </ul>
	     For instance :<ul>
		<li><i>"C:\Program Files\Bouml\bouml" "D:\...\aze\aze.prj" -exec C:\Progra~1\Bouml\cpp_generator</i></li>
		<li><i>bouml .../qsd/qsd.prj -exec "java -cp /tmp/wxc Main" -exit</i></li>
		</ul>
	     <br /><br /></li>

	<li> Add the new <i>drawing settings 'draw shadow'</i> to show or not the shadow introduced
	     in the release 2.14.4, it may be set on project, packages,
	     views and diagrams levels, <u>not</u> on a diagram element.
	     By default the shadows are shown, if you don't like
	     shadows set the <i>drawing settings</i> on the project level as usual to
	     globaly specify your choice.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,
	     the previous releases of BOUML cannot read a project
	     saved with this version. Obviously this release is
	     able to read the projects made by previous releases of BOUML.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

 
<h3>2.14.5</h3>May, 28th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Under Windows the path of the file edited by the editor
	     specified by <i>BOUML_EDITOR</i> is now a <i>Windows</i> path
	     rather than a <i>Unix</i> path (i.e. with '\' rather than '/')
	     to not disturb editor like <a href="http://www.pspad.com/"
	     target="_blank">PsPad</a>.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In a <i>class diagram</i> the <i>class associations</i> are now
	     automatically shown using an <i>anchor</i> between the relation
	     and the associated class, except if the <i>drawing setting
	     draw all classes relation</i> is set to no. This is done
	     then the relation is added in the diagram and the associated
	     class is present, or when you edit the relation to set/remove
	     the association and the relation and class are present.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Drawing an <i>anchor</i> between a relation and a class
	     now updates the class association. Deleting the <i>anchor</i>
	     doesn't remove the class association from the model, for that
	     you must edit the relation.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Java Generator 2.5.3</b><br />
	     Fixe a bug on the generation of the enum pattern items
	     introduced in the previous release.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Html documentation Generator 2.5.1</b><br />
	     Manage the actuals of a Java <i>generic</i> instantiation.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

 
<h3>2.14.4</h3>May, 21th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> The default position of a transition's label was wrong
	     when the <i>trigger, guard</i> and <i>activity</i> are
	     written verticaly, fixed.<br /><br /></li>
 
	<li> Change the default definition of an <i>enum</i> item
	     in Java to move <i>${@}</i> before <i>${name}</i>
	     rather than after.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> An actor is now drawn with its icon in a <i>sequence
	     diagram</i>.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Add a shadow to some elements in the diagrams. Note :
	     a transparent element doesn't have shadow.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Add the button <img src="doc/figs/optwinsize.png" alt="" border="0" />
	     in the diagrams helping to do an <i>Optimal windows size</i>
	     without using the menu of the diagrams menu<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Modify the <i>plug-out</i> API to add on the class
	     <i>UmlBaseRelation</i> the operation <i>side</i>,
	     if its argument is <i>true</i> returns the relation
	     associated to the role A, else the relation associated
	     to the role B or 0/null if the relation is non
	     bi-directional.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Java Generator 2.5.2</b><br />
	     Like in C++, when a class inherits or realizes a <i>generic</i>
	     class the tab <i>Instantiate</i> of the class dialog is the standard
	     way to specify the actuals. Now these actuals are generated
	     when the generalization/realization definition contains <i>${type}</i>.
	     When the class is undefined or is not known as a <i>generic</i>
	     because of the current environment the actuals have to be set directly
	     the relation's definition as I said in the historic of the release 
	     2.13<br />
	     Annotation was not generated for an <i>enum_pattern</i>, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Java Catalog 2.5.1</b><br />
	     <b>Java Reverse 2.5.1</b><br />
	     Management of the <i>generics</i><br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.2.2</b><br />
	     Produce '&gt; &gt;' rather than '&gt;&gt;' in a <i>template</i> 
	     class instantiation, adding a space before '&gt;' after the generation
	     of the last actuals being itself a <i>template</i> class.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Reverse 2.2.1</b><br />
	     The <i>namespace</i> containing reversed <i>enum</i>
	     and <i>typedef</i> was forgotten, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>XMI Generator 1.4</b><br />
	     Stop to generate a bi-directional relation as two
	     distinct relations.<br />
	     For the C++ generation, in some cases when a type being
	     an operation return value is defined, its name contains
	     the keyword <i>$&lt;inline&gt;</i>, fixed.<br />
	     Follows the new API<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Plug-out upgrade 1.3</b><br />
	    Upgrade the <i>plug-outs</i> to add the operation
	    <i>side</i> on <i>UmlbaseRelation</i>.<br />
	    This upgrade is not mandatory : old <i>plug-outs</i>
	    are compatible with this new releases of BOUML.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <i>Plug-out</i> <b>empty</b><br />
	     Upgraded by <i>Plug-out upgrade</i><br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Sort</b><br />
	     To avoid a conflict under Linux, the executable is
	     renamed from <i>sort</i> to <i>browsersort</i>.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Deploy 1.0</b><br />
	     New <i>plug-out</i>, must be applied on a <i>class view</i>.<br />
	     This <i>plug-out</i> automatizes the creation of the
	     <i>artifact</i> for all the classes of the <i>class view</i>
	     on which the <i>plug-out</i> ins applied :
	     <ul>
	     	<li> If the <i>class view</i> doesn't have an associated
	    		<i>deployment view</i>, an associated <i>deployment view</i>
	     		having the name of the <i>class view</i> is created
	     		in the same <i>package</i>. </li>
	     	<li> An <i>artifact</i> with the <i>stereotype source</i> is
	     		created and associated to all the classes of the 
	     		<i>class view</i> without associated <i>artifact</i>,
	     		the name of the <i>artifact</i> is the name of the
	     		<i>class</i>.</li>
	     </ul>
	     This <i>plug-out</i> is automatically configured on the
	     new project, to use it in your already existing project :
	     the name of the executable is <i>deplcl</i>, and
	     the target is a <i>class view</i>.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.14.3</h3>May, 1th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Add the commands <i>save optimal picture part</i> and
	     <i>copy optimal picture part</i> in the diagram's menu.
	     These commands do an <i>optimal window size</i> before
	     the corresponding <i>save/copy visible picture part</i>,
	     then restore the window size. This allows to get all the
	     elements of the diagram more easily.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> The <i>plug-out</i> operation <i>UmlBaseDiagram::saveIn</i>
	     did an <i>optimal scale</i> when the diagram doesn't have
	     a preferred size and scale. Now the <i>optimal scale</i>
	     is replaced by an <i>optimal window size</i>.
	     When the saved diagram is already opened, the current
	     scale is unchanged and an <i>optimal window size</i> is
	     done even if the diagram has a preferred size and scale.
	     This impacts the behavior of the <i>plug-out</i>
	     <b>Html documentation Generator</b><br /><br /></li>

	<li> Note : the behavior of the command <i>print</i> done through
	     the icon is unchanged, to print all the elements of the
	     active diagram do first an <i>optimal window size</i>.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />


<h3>2.14.2</h3>April, 29th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> <font color="red">When the scale is not 100%, the automatic
	     update of the position of the two intermediate points of a

    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.14</h3>April, 23th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Add the management of the visibility <i>package</i>. 
	     In C++ or Idl the visibility <i>package</i> is
	     translated to <i>public</i>.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> A relation's stereotype starting by the character '{'
	     is now not written between &lt; &lt; and &gt;&gt;,
	     this allows to specify the constraints through the
	     stereotype and to see them as desired.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Reverse 2.2</b><br />
	     To manage more Qt pre-processor identifiers and

	<li> <b>Plug-out upgrade 1.2</b><br />
	    Upgrade the <i>plug-outs</i> to manage <i>class association</i>
	    and the visibility <i>package</i>. <br />
	    This upgrade is <u>not</u> mandatory : old <i>plug-outs</i>
	    are compatible with this new releases of BOUML,
	    they receive the visibility <i>public</i> rather than
	    <i>package</i> even in Java.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,
	     the previous releases of BOUML cannot read a project
	     saved with this version. Obviously this release is
	     able to read the projects made by previous releases of BOUML.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.13</h3>April, 17th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Starting to draw a relation and doing an undo 
	     before to reach the target has undesired effect depending
	     on the next action,
	     <font color="red">including a crash</font>, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Add the possibility to set the geometry of the lines
	     in the diagram (except for the messages in a
	     <i>sequence diagram</i>) to have a right angle
	     (<img src="doc/figs/linegeo1.png" alt="" border="0" /> or 
	      <img src="doc/figs/linegeo2.png" alt="" border="0" />) or a crank
	     (<img src="doc/figs/linegeo3.png" alt="" border="0" /> or 
	      <img src="doc/figs/linegeo4.png" alt="" border="0" />).<br />
	     While you do not change by hand the position of the
	     central line of a crank the geometry is preserved
	     when you move one of the extremity of the crank, else
	     the central line stop to be automatically moved.<br />
	     To set / unset the geometry of a line you may select the
	     line and press <i>Control l</i> as many time as necessary,
	     or call the menu of the line and use the sub-menu
	     <i>geometry</i>.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Change the way to specify a <i>generalisation</i> or
	     <i>realization</i>.
	     In the previous releases these relations are generated
	     when they are specified as <i>Generated</i> through the
	     button <i>Generated in</i> or by default thanks to the
	     toggle <i>default definition</i> in the menu
	     <i>Miscellaneous</i>.<br />
	     From now the button <i>Generated</i> is replaced by the
	     button <i>Default declaration</i> and the default form
	     became <i>${type}</i> which is replaced during the code
	     generation by the name of the <i>generalised</i> or
	     <i>realized</i> class. This allows to modify the code
	     generated, for instance in Java to replace the inheritance
	     to <i>Sequence</i> by <i>Sequence&lt;int&gt;</i> replacing
	     the default declaration by <i>${type}&lt;int&gt;</i>.<br />
	     Of course when you load an old project the form
	     <i>Generated</i> is automatically changed to
	     <i>${type}</i>.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Add the management of the <i>class associations</i>. The
	     relation dialog is modified to allow to specify the
	     associated class or type, this one is generated through
	     the new keyword <i>${association}</i>.<br />
	     Note : you must add the keyword <i>${association}</i> by
	     hand in the declaration, for instance in C++ if you
	     have a relation to the class C and the associated class
	     is K and you want to specify a <i>stl map</i> having the
	     key <i>K</i> and the value <i>C</i>, set the stereotype
	     to <i>map</i>, specify a multiplicity like *,
	     ask for the default declaration, and replace the form
	     <i>&lt;${type}&gt;</i> by <i>&lt;${association}, ${type}&gt;</i><br />
	     Note : the management of the <i>class associations</i> is not yet
	     done in the <i>class diagrams</i><br /><br /></li>

	<li> In java a class member has a <i>package visibility</i>
	     when the keyword <i>${visibility}</i> is not present in
	     its definition. In a class diagram, when the <i>drawing
	     language</i> is Java, the visibility marker (+, - or #)
	     is now not shown for the class's members having a
	     package visibility.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Change the way to compute the 'get_' and 'set_' operations
	     to manage cases where the default operation definition
	     contains additional '}' after the '}' ending the body
	     (for instance because of a comment containing a keyword).
	     Manage <i>class associations</i><br /><br /></li>

	<li> Add the <i>landscape</i> formats corresponding
	     to the already existing formats of diagram.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Reverse 2.1</b><br />
	     In the previous releases an own <i>artifact</i> was created
	     for each reversed class. From now the classes defined in
	     the same <u>header</u> file will be associated to the same
	     <i>artifact</i> named like the reversed file. Of course this
	     is possible only if all the classes are in the same
	     namespace or are not in a namespace, else one <i>artifact</i>
	     per namespace will be created in different <i>packages</i>.<br />
	     The classes defined in a <u>source</u> file rather than a
	     header file are associated to an <i>artifact</i> having the
	     name of the class. Note that if the classes <i>A</i>
	     and <i>B</i> are reverse from the file <i>C.h</i>, and if a
	     source file in the same directory define the class <i>C</i>,
	     and if the three classes are defined in the same namespace
	     or are not defined in a namespace, the three classes will
	     associated to the same <i>artifact C</i>, whatever the name
	     of the source file defining the class <i>C</i>.<br />

	     To manage the new definition of the <i>generalisation</i>
	     and <i>realization</i>.<br />

	     Note : the <i>class associations</i> are not yet used by
	     the reverse.<br /><br /></li>

	     the previous releases of BOUML cannot read a project
	     saved with this version. Obviously this release is
	     able to read the projects made by previous releases of BOUML.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.12.2</h3>April, 9th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> The code generations are now made in non verbose mode by default,
	     to set / unset the verbose mode use the corresponding toggle in
	     the menu <i>Miscellaneous</i>. Note : this toggle is saved
	     in the session file<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Plug-out upgrade 1.1</b><br />
	    Upgrade the <i>plug-outs</i> mainly to manage the Java JDK 5,
	    this upgrade is <u>not</u> mandatory : old <i>plug-outs</i>
	    are compatible with this new releases of BOUML.<br />
	    To use the new features on an existing <i>plug-out</i>,
	    because of the renamings explain below, you <u>must</u>
	    upgrade the <i>plug-out</i> <u>before</u> modifying your
	    sources to call new operations.<br />
	    In case the upgrade is done :
	    <ul>
	      <li> <font color="green">Some operations of the class

<h3>2.12.1</h3>April, 4th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> <font color="red">Since the release 2.11 the edition of
	     a <u>read-only</u> class, operation, attribute or relation 
	     crashes BOUML</font>, fixed.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.12</h3>April, 2th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> After setting a default color for the class instances
	     at a <i>sequence diagram</i> or <i>collaboration diagram</i>
	     level it was not possible to reload the project (produced
	     the error message <font color="red">'end' expected
	     rather than 'class_instance'</font>), fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Fixe bugs in the computing of minimum size or the
	     resizeable diagram elements (<i>package, node</i> etc ...) 
	     depending on the zoom.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> The drawing settings <i>show packages name in tab</i>
	     was not always correctly managed, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Management of the Java JDK 5 <i>generics</i>. The tab
	     <i>Parametrized</i> of the class dialog is modified. In
	     Java only the columns <i>name</i> and optionaly <i>extends</i>
	     are used. The definition of a class is not modified (this
	     means that there is no new keywords), if the class has
	     parameters they are generated after the class's name
	     by <i>${name}</i>.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> New font management helping Qt to use a font
	     corresponding to the scale. Note : the improvement depends on the
	     OS and the Qt release : there is no change with Qt 2.3 under Linux,
	     small fonts are now used with Qt 3 under Linux and with Qt 2.3 under
	     windows.<br /><br /></li>
	     
	<li> Adds new colors including white.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In the annotation dialog indicates the member's name
	     when you add an annotation having at least two members.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Java Generator 2.3</b><br />
	     Adds the management of the <i>generics</i>.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Java Catalog 2.3</b><br />
	     <b>Java Reverse 2.3</b><br />
	     Adds the management of the annotations's operations
	     with a default value. Remark : the management of the
	     <i>generics</i> is not yet done.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,
	     the previous releases of BOUML cannot read a project
	     saved with this version. Obviously this release is
	     able to read the projects made by previous releases of BOUML.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.11</h3>March, 26th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Management of the Java JDK 5 <i>annotations</i>.<br />
	     Adds the class stereotype <i>@interface</i>, when you
	     ask for the default annotation definition in Java, the
	     default <i>interface</i> definition is used then '@' is
	     added before <i>interface</i>.<br />
	     The new keyword <i>${@}</i> is allowed in the Java definition
	     of the classes, attributes, associations and operations,
	     of course this keyword is replaced by the annotations by
	     the code generator. When you create a new project this keyword
	     is placed after <i>${comment}</i>.<br />
	     In the dialogs the button <i>Edit annotation</i> is added
	     to modify the annotations through a dedicated dialog.
	     The proposed annotations are the pre-defined Java annotations
	     <i>@Deprecated, @Documented, @Inherit, @Override, @Retention,
 	     @SuppressWarnings</i> and <i>@Target</i>
	     more the classes having the stereotype <i>@interface</i>,
	     but any annotation may be enter by hand in the multi-lines
	     editor.<br />
	     Obviously the button <i>Edit annotation</i> is only active
	     when the definition contains the keyword <i>${@}</i>,
	     you have to add the keyword in the definitions of the old
	     projects to be able to set the annotations<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Java Generator 2.2</b><br />
	     Adds the management of the <i>annotations</i>.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Java Catalog 2.2</b><br />
	     <b>Java Reverse 2.2</b><br />
	     Adds the management of the <i>annotations</i>.<br />
	     Manage class's members without specified visibility<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Html Generator 2.3.2</b><br />
	     <b>XMI Generator 1.1.3</b><br />
	     To bypass <i>${@}</i> in the definitions.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,
	     the previous releases of BOUML cannot read a project
	     saved with this version. Obviously this release is
	     able to read the projects made by previous releases of BOUML.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.10</h3>March, 21th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> <i>Deployment nodes</i> was improperly resized in some
	     cases, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> The resize of a resizeable element (<i>package, note</i>...)
	     was wrongly managed by <i>undo / redo</i>, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> When a move is done through the keyboard arrows using the auto
	     repeat, the complete move is saved in the historic rather than 
	     each individual move.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Add a button <i>edit</i> in the diagram's toolbar to call the
	     diagram's menu like with a right mouse click done out of
	     all the elements.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Add new format of diagrams : Iso A0 and A1, US D and E.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> When you move a <i>package</i> in a diagram, the
	     <i>artifact, class, component, deployment node, package</i> and
	     <i>use cases</i> defined in the <i>package</i> (not through an
	     other one) and in collision with the <i>package</i>
	     at the beginning of the move are also moved. If you want to
	     also move the connected elements, do a very short move
	     (for instance use the keyboard arrows to do a move and its opposite)
	     then ask for <i>select linked items</i> and restart the move.
	     Note : contrarilly to the <i>states></i> when you
	     resize a <i>package</i> the sub-elements are not moved to stay
	     in it.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Reverse 2.0.9</b><br />
	     Adds the management of the <i>template friend</i> in C++.<br />
	     Other improvements<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>File Control 1.0.3</b><br />
	     Your command is applied on the auxiliairy files <i>cpp_includes,
	     generation_settings, idl_includes, java_imports, stereotypes</i>
	     and <i>tools</i> when the <i>Plug-out</i> in applied on the project.
	     Check if a file exists before applying the command.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,
	     the previous releases of BOUML cannot read a project
	     saved with this version. Obviously this release is
	     able to read the projects made by previous releases of BOUML.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.9.7</h3>March, 14th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> <b>File Control 1.0.2</b><br />
	     Do the save <u>before</u> applying the command on
	     the files ! Two errors on a so small program, grrrrrr :-(</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.9.6</h3>March, 13th 2006<br /><br />

	<li> <b>File Control 1.0.1</b><br />
	     Fixe a bug in the computing of <i>%dir</i>, sorry.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.9.5</h3>March, 12th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Adds <i>Undo Redo</i> in the diagrams, the shortcuts are
	     <i>Control-z</i> and <i>Control-u</i> for <i>undo</i>,
	     <i>Control-y</i> and <i>Control-r</i> for <i>redo</i>.
	     The depth of the historic is 20, it is emptied
	     on the editions (including the <i>drawing setting</i> edition),
	     the browser element deletion/undeletion, the change of scale
	     or diagram format, etc ... The undoable operations are moving,
	     removing from view, element adding.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> The menu of a <i>class diagram</i> (shown on a right mouse
	     click done in the diagram out of any diagram element)
	     proposes the new entry <i>add classes of the selected
	     class view</i> when the selected browser element is
	     a <i>class view</i> containing class(es) not already
	     shown in the <i>class diagram</i>.<br /><br /></li>
	     
	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.0.16</b><br />
	     Fixe a bug in the calculation of the dependencies.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>XMI Generator 1.1.2</b><br />
	     Do not place several <i>UML:TaggedValue</i> in the same
	     <i>ModelElement.taggedValue</i><br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Java Catalog 2.1.3</b><br />
	     <b>Java Reverse 2.1.2</b><br />
	     It was not possible to reverse a nested <i>enum</i>, fixed<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Html Generator 2.3.1</b><br />
	     Rename the generated files <i>index_X</i> where <i>X</i> is
	     a character, replacing this one by its ascii code to not have
	     illegal filenames under Windows.<br /><br /></li>
	     
	<li> <i>Plug-out</i> <b>empty</b><br />
		Fixe the profile of <i>UmlBasePackage::getProject()</i>
	        to return a <i>UmlPackage</i> rather than a
	        <i>UmlBasePackage</i>.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>File Control 1.0</b><br />
	     New <i>plug-out</i>, must be applied on the project
	     or a package.<br />
	     This <i>plug-out</i> is written to do <i>check-in</i>
	     or  <i>check-out</i> on the files of a project.
	     Because I don't know what file control you use (CVS ...)
	     this <i>plug-out</i> asks for the command to be made on
	     each file. The command is executed through the function
	     <i>system</i>, <u>don't forget to give the option -nc for
	     <i>clear case</i></u>. Of course in case you don't use
	     a file control you may use this <i>plug-out</i> to set
	     the file permissions using <i>chmod</i>
	     in the commands under Linux etc ...<br />
	     This <i>plug-out</i> is automatically configured on the
	     new project, to use it in your already existing project :
	     the name of the executable is <i>file_control</i>, you must
	     specify a first parameter being <i>ci</i> or <i>co</i>
	     (so this <i>plug-out</i> is declared two times), and
	     the target is the project or a <i>package</i>. Create a
	     new project and look at the tool settings to have an example
	     of configuration.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.9.4</h3>February, 27th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Adds the management of the <i>template operations</i> in C++.
	     A <i>template operation</i> has an empty declaration and
	     the actuals are directly specified in the definition (of course
	     between <i>${class}</i> and ::).<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Reverse 2.0.8</b><br />
	     Adds the management of the <i>template operations</i> in C++.<br />
	     Adds a progress bar, the progress is based on the number
	     of files, not on the time<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.0.15</b><br />
	     Adds the management of the <i>template operations</i> in C++.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>XMI Generator 1.1.1</b><br />
	     Allows to choose how the <i>tagged values</i> are generated,
	     because some tools don't accept some form.
	     <i>tagged values</i> are used to produce description (may be
	     on several lines), <i>stereotypes</i>, <i>user properties</i>
	     and type definition.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.9.3</h3>February, 22th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> <font color="red"><i>duplicate marked after</i> could
	     have dramatic effects</font>, for instance crashing

	<li> It was not possible to edit the description or something
	     else from the class dialog using the <i>Editor</i> button
	     with <i>BOUML_EDITOR</i> unset : the internal editor didn't
	     have the focus, fixed.<br /><br /></li>
	     
	<li> <i>Plug-out</i> <b>empty</b><br />
		Add a missing 't' in the Java definition of
		UmlBaseClass::setAssociatedClasses()<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.0.14</b><br />

	<li> <b>Sort</b><br />
	     This is a new <i>plug-out</i>, allowing to re-order elements
	     in <i>packages</i>, <i>views</i> and <i>use cases</i>.
	     Its realization both in C++ and Java is detailled in the new
	     <a href="tutorial/tutorial_plugout.html" target="_blank">

    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.9.2</h3>February, 13th 2006<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Little improvements made in conjontion with the writing of

    <ul>
	<li> Management of the Java JDK 5 <i>enums</i>.
	     <i>Generics</i> and <i>annotations</i> will be added later.<br />
	     <font color="green">When you load a project made by a previous release :</font>
	     <ul>
		<li> <font color="green">
		     The may be existing class stereotype <i>enum_pattern</i>
		     is renamed (the new name is context dependent and
		     is given in a message box), and the classes having
		     this stereotype are modified to have the new one</font></li>
		<li> <font color="green">
		     Except for the class stereotype <i>enum</i>, the
	 	     class stereotypes valuing <i>enum</i> in Java are
		     modified to become <i>enum_pattern</i> in Java
		     (one suposes this stereotype didn't exist because
		     it has not special meaning for Java).</font></li>
		<li> <font color="green">
		     The class stereotype <i>enum_pattern</i> is created
		     from the class stereotype <i>enum</i> replacing
		     the Java stereotype <i>enum</i> with <i>enum_pattern</i>.</font></li>
		<li> <font color="green">

	     The classes having the stereotype <i>enum_pattern</i>
	     are managed like the old Java pseudo enum.
	     The classes having the stereotype <i>enum</i>
	     are managed like the Java enum introduced by the JDK 5.<br />
	     Because a Java JDK 5 enum may have attributes, relations
	     and operations, it is now possible to add these kinds
	     of members to a class having the stereotype <i>enum</i>, but
	     the their default definitions are empty in C++ and Idl.<br />
	     The keyword <i>${items}</i> is introduced in the Java definition
	     of a JDK 5 enum, it has no meaning is the other cases, 
	     during the Java code generation it is replaced by the enum
	     constants and the keyword <i>${members}</i> is replaced by
	     the other members.<br />
	     To distinguish the attributes corresponding to the enums
	     constants and the other attributes, the stereotype
	     <i>attribute</i> is introduced, this one indicates a non
	     enum constant. So, the attributes having the stereotype
	     <i>attribute</i> are generated by <i>${members}</i>, the
	     others by <i>${items}</i><br />
	     New <i>generation settings</i> are added to specify the
	     code generated for the JDK 5 enums.<br />
	     To be still compatible with the Java JDK 1.x the Java definition
	     of the API of the <i>plug-outs</i> don't and will not use
	     the Java JDK 5 enums.<br /><br /></li>
	
	<li> Little changes to compile under Mac OS X.

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,

<br /><br />
             
<h3>2.7.8</h3>December, 22th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Fixe a bug on the management of deleted items still
	     referenced during the project reading.
	     <font color="red">Previous releases may crash on this
	     case of non consistency</font>.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Now when you ask for <i>referenced by</i> on a class,
	     the attributes, operations and classes referencing the target
	     class at the UML level are also given. Note : the
	     operations's bodies are not taken into acount.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Management of <i>${h_value}</i> in the C++ declaration of
	     attributes and relations, see below. Because only the
	     C++ declaration is showed in the C++ tab of the attribute and
	     relation dialogs, the initial value is only shown when the
	     keyword <i>${h_value}</i> is used.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.0.11</b><br />
	     For a given artifact, when the header file definition contains
	     <i>${all_includes}</i> no declaration are produced
	     in the header file and all the <i>#includes</i> are produced in
	     the header file, except the <i>#includes</i> of the header file
	     in the source file of course.<br />
	     The already existing keyword <i>${value}</i> is still replaced
	     in the <u>definition</u> of a <i>static</i> attribute or
	     relation by the initial value.
	     The new keyword <i>${h_value}</i> is replaced in the
	     <u>declaration</u> of a <i>static</i> attribute or
	     relation by the initial value.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Reverse 2.0.6</b><br />
	     Management of <i>${h_value}</i> : when the initial value of a
	     <i>static</i> attribute or relation is specified in the declaration,
	     force the attribute or relation specification to contain
	     <i>${h_value}</i> else <i>${value}</i>.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Html Generator 2.2.1</b><br />
	     Management of <i>${h_value}</i><br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>XMI Generator 1.0.6</b><br />
	     Add generation of the C++ and Java definition. When you
	     start the XMI generator, this one ask you to choose between
	     the UML, C++ or Java exported definitions.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />
             
<h3>2.7.7</h3>December, 4th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> In the class and operation dialog, when you edited something
	     in a table (for instance the name of an operation's parameter)
	     and you went directly in an other tab, the change in the
	     table was not taken into account. It was necessary to
	     click elsewhere in the table before went in another tab, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>XMI Generator 1.0.5</b><br />
	     The user properties are exported and produce <i>tagged values</i>.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />
             
<h3>2.7.6</h3>December, 3th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> The Windows version didn't allow to use an editor
	     (specified by BOUML_EDITOR) placed in a directory having a path
	     containing spaces, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> The extension of the auto generated file's
	     name edited by the editor specified through BOUML_EDITOR
	     is now the one specified through the <i>generation settings</i>.
	     For the Windows version : set the filename to contains
	     only valid characters.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In the Java and Idl tabs of the <i>artifact</i> dialog the '$' is
	     just replaced by '@' and the <i>user keywords</i> are not
	     replaced by their values (in fact BOUML tries to manage a
	     <i>user keywords</i> when it finds a '$' rather than a '@'
	     because of a typing error), fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> When a class or its members was changed, its self
	     relations moved a little bit in the class diagrams
	     without true reason, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> The stereotype of a duplicated marked browser item may not be
	     visible even this is asked, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In the previous releases an operation could not be
	     <i>virtual</i> and <i>inline</i> at the same time, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In the sub-menu <i>add inherited operations</i> the
	     abstract operations are now written in italic. In the
	     associated dialog used when there are too many inherited
	     operations, the abstract operations's profile has the
	     header <i>[a]</i> (to use italic is not possible).<br /><br /></li>

	<li> When an operation is duplicated (even through
	     <i>add inherited operations</i>), its C++ and Java bodies
	     are also copied.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In the previous releases a class could not be provided/realized by
	     several components, remove this limitation. Change the browser
	     class menu <i>select associated component</i> by the sub menu
	     <i>select associated components</i> allowing to select a
	     component provided or realizing the class when several components
	     do that. The API with the
	     <i>Plug-outs</i> is modified, the operation <i>associatedComponent</i>
	     defined on <i>UmlBaseClass</i> is renamed <i>associatedComponents</i>
	     and now returns a vector of components.
	     Old <i>Plug-outs</i> may be used with this release, in this case
	     only one component chosen randomly is returned by
	     <i>associatedComponent</i>.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> New C++ and Java default operation definition according
	     to their body indent (2 spaces by default), see below<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.0.10</b><br />
	     <b>Java Generator 2.0.4</b><br />
	     New way to specify the indent of the operations body. In the previous releases it was
	     necessary to indent all the lines. Now an indent added to
	     each line may be specified, this indent is the spaces and tabs
	     placed between <i>${body}</i> and the first previous
	     character not equal to a space and a tab.<br />
	     In C++ : when the last characters of a line are '\' followed by
	     an optional carriage return then a newline, the next line
	     is not indented; When the first character of a line is '#'
	     this line is not indented; These two rules are applied
	     whatever the context, the code generator doesn't check if
	     the characters are in a comment, a string or a literal
	     character.<br />
	     When the body is empty the spaces and tabs placed before
	     <i>${body}</i> are <u>not</u> output.
	     The right way is just to add spaces or tabs before the keyword
	     <i>${body}</i>, itself followed by '}'. This is the new default
	     definition of a C++ operation for new projects<br />
	     Because the keyword <i>${body}</i> was <i>a priori</i> not
	     indented in the definition of the operations for the
	     previous releases, this new feature doesn't have undesired
	     effect on old operations.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Reverse 2.0.5</b><br />
	     <b>Java Reverse 2.0.4</b><br />
	     Because the bodies of the operation is already indented,
	     remove the indent of the keyword <i>${body}</i> in the
	     reversed operations's definition<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Idl Generator 2.0.4</b><br />
	     Fixe a bug in the generation of the operations's exceptions<br />
	     Add a missing ';' at the end of a module definition<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Plug-out upgrade 1.0.3</b><br />
	     Upgrade the operation <i>associatedComponent</i>
	     defined on <i>UmlBaseClass</i> to return several components.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Html Generator 2.2</b><br />
	     <i>Plug-out</i> <b>empty</b><br />
	     Upgraded to manage several components realizing/providing a class.
	     They can't be used this previous releases of BOUML<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>XMI Generator 1.0.4</b><br />
	     Manage characters " &amp; &lt; and &gt; in strings</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />
    

<h3>2.7.5</h3>November, 16th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> All the <i>generation settings</i> was not read with 
	     release 2.7.4, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Under Linux with a QT release 3.x it was not possible to
	     edit the <i>user properties</i> value. Partially fixed,
	     currently <i>return</i> goes to another cell and doesn't
	     insert a newline.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Set the size of the diagrams under Windows as it was 
	     already made under Linux when a session is restored.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Stop to save / restore the browser's scroolbars position,
	     but force the selected browser item to be visible when
	     a session is restored. However the session files created by
	     the previous release of BOUML are managed by this release.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />
             
<h3>2.7.4</h3>November, 13th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> When a project is closed the current session (opened
	     diagrams list, browser view etc ...) is saved to be
	     restored the next time the project will be load.<br />
	     The file used to save the sessions is placed among the
	     other files of the projects and is named
	     <i>&lt;uid&gt;.session</i>, where <i>&lt;uid&gt;</i> is the value
	     of <i>BOUML_ID</i> to allow each user to have his own
	     session. This feature is not provided when <i>BOUML_ID</i>
	     is not defined.<br />
	     The size of the diagrams sub-windows
	     is restored (except under Windows else the program goes
	     in an infinite loop inside Qt), not their position because
	     this information is not available (private in Qt classes).<br />
	     The scroolbar position is not restored in the browser
	     (even I ask for).<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Improve the displacement of the objects in a diagram
	     when the scale is changed, moving their center rather
	     than their top-left corner (yes, at last !).<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Hide the limits of the diagram canvas when you print it<br /><br /></li>

	<li> When the drawing of a class is modified in a class diagram,
	     its center is unchanged, and the line breaks of the class's
	     self relations are moved if needed to not have them under
	     the class picture. Before when a self relation was hidden
	     because the class picture grew it was not easy to show it
	     again manually.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />
             
<h3>2.7.3</h3>November, 7th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Add some checks concerning the <i>state machine</i><br /><br /></li>

	<li> Indicate why a relation can't be added<br /><br /></li>

	<li> New dialog to help C++ programmers to manage the parameters
	     of the operations, called through the new buttons placed
	     in the tab C++ of the operation dialog<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>State machine generator 1.0.2</b><br />
             Add <i>entry point, terminate</i> management</li>

    </ul>
<br /><br />
             
<h3>2.7.2</h3>November, 3th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Take immediatly into account the new value of the
	     <i>user keywords</i> for the forms <i>@{...}</i>
	     in the dialogs to show the result after
	     substitution.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.0.9</b><br />
	     A non defined <i>user keyword</i> associated to 
	     a form <i>@{...}</i> may produced an infinite loop,
	     fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>State machine generator 1.0.1</b><br />
             Add <i>completion transition</i> management</li>

    </ul>
<br /><br />
             
<h3>2.7.1</h3>November, 1th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> <b>XMI generator 1.0.3</b><br />
	     Fixe class's relations generation<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.0.8</b><br />
	     Fixe a bug associated to the nested classes<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Html Generator 2.1.4</b><br />
	     Write transition's name<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>State machine generator 1.0</b><br />
             This is a new <i>plug-out</i>, produce the classes
	     implementing a <i>state machine</i>.<br />
	     Must be applied on a <i>state machine</i>.
	     This <i>plug-out</i> is configured by default
	     in the new projects. The name of the executable to
	     add it to the <i>plug-outs</i> list in of the existing
	     projects is <i>stmgen</i>.<br />
	     It is under development, the <i>pseudo states fork, join,
	     entry point, terminate, deep history, shallow history</i> and the
	     <i>regions</i> are not yet managed, nor the <i>completion</i>
	     (you must specify <i>triggers</i>). Currently this
	     <i>Plug-out</i> is implemented in C++ and
	     produce C++ definition, it will be also implemented in Java
	     to produce Java definition (why not !).<br />
	     When you apply this <i>plug-out</i> on a <i>state machine</i>
	     a class having the same name (removing non legal characters)
	     is created in the same <i>class view</i> to implement it.
	     This class doesn't contain <i>static</i> attributes and may
	     have several instances. Each sub-state is managed through an own
	     sub-class, the tree of the states and the associated classes 
	     is the same. For each <i>trigger</i>, whatever the
	     state waiting for it, an operation having the same name
	     (the C++ <i>trigger</i> must have a legal C++ name, the
	     C++ <i>guards</i> must be legal C++ forms etc ...) is
	     defined. Currently the <i>triggers</i> can't have parameters,
	     and a <i>transition</i> can't have several <i>triggers</i>.
	     You must apply these operations on the instance of the
	     class implementing the state machine to simulate the event,
	     the returned value is <i>true</i> until the <i>final</i>
	     state is reached. The <i>operation</i> starting the execution
	     is named <i>create</i> (the only legal <i>trigger</i> for
	     a transition from an <i>initial pseudo state</i>).
	     A trigger's name can't start by the character '_', allowing
	     me to produce operations and attributes starting by '_'
	     without collision.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.7</h3>October, 27th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> BOUML wasn't compilable with GCC 4.0.x, fixe this problem
	     even I don't really trust on these GCC releases (see
	     <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24485"
	     target="_blank">message</a>).<br /><br /></li>

	<li> The files <i>generation_settings, tools, stereotypes,
	     cpp_includes, java_imports</i> and <i>idl_includes</i>
	     are now re-written only when they are <u>really</u> modified.
	     Note that for performance purpose this check is not done for
	     all the other files, for instance when you do a change, thus
	     undo it, the corresponding files will be re-written.<br /><br /></li>
	
	<li> Nested class visibility is editable<br /><br /></li>

	<li> When a form <i>@{xyz}</i> is found by the
	     code generators and the associated dialogs, and <i>xyz</i>
	     is a key of a <i>user property</i>, this one is replaced by the
	     corresponding value. The <i>user property</i> is seached
	     first in the item for which the code is generated, if not
	     found in its parent, if not found in its grand-parent
	     etc ...<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Java Generator 2.0.3</b><br />

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.0.7</b><br />
	     Add management of <i>@{xyz}</i> forms.<br />
	     Doesn't generate the full definition of an initialized
	     <i>static const attribute</i> only in the header file,
	     the attribute is defined and initialized in the
	     source file.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>XMI generator 1.0.2</b><br />
	     The generation of a <i>package</i> for the views is
	     optional. Memorize the filename used for the previous
	     XMI generation to propose it by default.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,
	     the previous releases of BOUML cannot read a project
	     saved with this version. Obviously this release is
	     able to read the projects made by previous releases of BOUML.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.6.4</h3>October, 21th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> When you quit BOUML closing its window through your window 
	     manager capabilities rather than using <i>project &gt; quit</i>
	     and the project is modified, BOUML will ask you to confirm.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> When a <i>class, use case, use case view</i> or a <i>package</i>
	     is moved by drap-and-drop in the browser and may be placed
	     <i>in</i> or <i>after</i> the destination, BOUML ask for you to choose.
	     The class menu entries <i>set it nested in</i> and <i>extract
	     from</i> becoming useless are removed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Add management of the keyword <i>${inline}</i> in the

	<li> <b>Plug-out upgrade 1.0.2</b><br />
	     To add the operation <i>UmlBaseItem::moveAfter</i> allowing to change 
	     the order of the items in the browser (staying under the
	     same parent), and to access / modify the new
	     <i>generation settings</i> managing the default description
	     and the default return type forms introduced in the 2.6
	     </li>

	<li> <b>XMI generator 1.0.1</b><br />
	     Fixe indentation of <i>&lt;/Generalization&gt;</i>.<br />
	     In an operation's parameter whose type is a class,
	     replace <i>UML:DataType</i> by <i>UML:Classifier</i>.<br />
	     The <i>dependency</i>'s client and supplier was reversed,
	     fixed.<br />
	     Some tools doesn't accept "*" in a mulplicity specification,
	     replace "*" by "0..-1", "2..*" by "2..-1" etc ...<br />
	     Classes defined under a <i>use case</i> or a <i>use case
	     view</i> are generated as <i>actor</i>, their operations,

<h3>2.6.2</h3>October, 13th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> It was not possible to read a project containing
	     an <i>extra member</i> having a stereotype (produced
	     the error message <font color="red">'end' expected
	     rather than 'stereotype'</font>), fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> The <i>extra member</i> dialog forgot to set the stereotype,

	     are saved in the produced file.<br />
	     To be compatible with existing tools, the format is
	     <i>xml 1.0, xmi 1.2</i> for <i>UML 1.4</i>.<br />
	     This <i>plug-out</i> is configured by default

    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.6.1</h3>October, 2th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> After changing the rank of messages in a collaboration
	     diagram, some of them are not shown sorted, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In a collaboration diagram, when you edit a message which

	     not included in the message list, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Changing the format of a diagram didn't have the
	     expected behavior when the zoom was not 100%, fixed<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Change the default Z position of the relations and other
	     lines in the diagrams to be dependent on the Z position
	     of the extremities<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Show the limits of the diagram canvas</li>
    </ul>

<h3>2.6</h3>September, 26th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> <font color="red">Unfortunately it was possible to draw an <i>anchor</i> from a
	     class to a <i>line break point</i> in a class diagram, with
	     dramatic consequences</font>, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Since the release 2.5.4, in the <i>sequence</i> and <i>class diagrams</i> the full
	     operations displaying was wrong in C++ mode, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> When a <i>plug-out</i> can't be lauch under Windows
	     because the executable can't be found (PATH problem etc ...)
	     a message box is displayed from now on.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> The definition of a <i>set_</i> operation was wrong in C++
	     and Java when the attribute / relation name is not the
	     UML name (definition of the <i>get_</i> operation was right),
	     fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In the operation dialog, add buttons <i>default definition</i>
	     and <i>default declaration</i> for the <i>get_</i> and
	     <i>set_</i> operations.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> New <i>generation settings</i> to specify default description
	     for <i>artifacts, classes, operations, attributes</i>
	     and <i>relations</i>.
	     A new tab is added in the <i>generation settings</i> dialog
	     to set them, by default they are empty.
	     Add the button <i>default</i> to fill the description with
	     the default value in the corresponding dialogs. 
             From now on, <font color="green"><u>keyword substitutions are
	     made in the description of the corresponding objects
	     as for their declarations / definitions</u></font>. This
	     feature is under construction.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> New <i>generation settings</i> for C++ allowing to set the
	     default form specifying the operation return type form.
	     The affected tabs of the <i>generation settings</i> dialog
	     are the first one and the fourth C++ tab.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Change a little the UML tab of the relation dialog to save
	     height, and a <i>splitter</i> is placed between the two
	     roles to choose their respective height.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.0.5</b><br />
	     The path generated for an <i>#include</i> was wrong
	     when <i>#include with pathname</i> is set in the <i>generation
	     settings</i> and the header files are generated in different
	     directories, fixed.<br />
	     Fixe <i>carriage return / line feed</i> problem in code
	     generation under Windows.<br />
	     When the name of a <i>static</i> attribute or relation
	     is not the same in UML and C++ the definition of the C++
	     variable was wrong (the declaration was correct), fixed.<br />
	     Do keywords substitution in the comments (to be completed).<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Java Generator 2.0.2</b><br />
	     <b>Idl Generator 2.0.2</b><br />
	     Fixe <i>carriage return / line feed</i> problem in code
	     generation under Windows<br />
	     Do keywords substitution in the comments (to be completed).<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,
	     the previous releases of BOUML cannot read a project
	     saved with this version. Obviously this release is
	     able to read the projects made by previous releases of BOUML.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.5.5</h3>September, 18th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> When the browser sub-window is scrolled horizontally the
	     <i>drag &amp; drop</i> of a browser's item was not always
	     possible, fixed<br /><br /></li>

	<li> With BOUML compiled with Qt3, resizing a graphic item
	     using the mouse had a strange behavior except for the
	     bottom right corner, fixed. Note : the delivered version
	     of BOUML for Windows use QT2 and didn't have this bug.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> When you rename a class, the contructors and destructor
	     are now automatically renamed<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Add UML 2 standard stereotypes<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.0.4</b><br />
	     When an <i>artifact</i> is associated to several classes
	     some of them could miss in the declaration list produced
	     for <i>${declarations}</i>, fixed<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <i>Plug-out</i> <b>empty</b><br />
             Updated to rename the contructors and destructor
	     when their class is renamed<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Plug-out upgrade 1.0.1</b><br />
	     Add the renaming of the contructors and destructor
	     when their class is renamed<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ utilities 1.0</b><br />
	     New <i>plug-out</i> for C++ modeling. Actually this
	     one works on class to help to add contructor (without
	     parameter), destructor (<i>virtual</i> or not), copy
	     constructor (with parameter <i>const</i> or not) and
	     assignment operator (with parameter <i>const</i> or not),
	     of course all these operations have an empty body.
	     This <i>plug-out</i> is defined in C++ and will be
	     extended depending on your requests. The name of the
	     executable is <i>cpp_util</i><br /><br />
	     
	     Because I am not a Java developer, I don't know what may
	     be usefull for Java, don't hesitate to ask for a Java
	     utilities <i>plug-out</i></li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.5.4</h3>September, 11th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> <font color="red">Previous releases may crash when you close
	     a dialog without closing the sub editions lauched through
	     the button <i>editor</i> with BOUML_EDITOR not defined</font>,
	     fixed. Furthemore now when you do it, BOUML ask you to confirm
	     the loss of the modifications made through the sub editions not
	     yet closed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> When you created a dependency between two components
	     the result was a generalization, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> The size of a closed dialog is saved to be re-used
	     the next time a dialog of the same type will be opened.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Force the drawing name of a <i>use case</i> to be on
	     the top of the <i>use case</i> picture<br /><br /></li>

	<li> The keyword <i>${description}</i> is added for the code
	     generation. This one similar to <i>${comment}</i> except
	     that the code generators produce the description part 
	     without adding "//" or /* .. */. This allows you to choose
	     between the two ways to produce the comments. This new
	     keyword is of course managed by the reverse in case it is
	     used in the defaults set through the <i>generation settings</i>.
	     When this new keyword is used, the reverse doesn't remove
	     the "//" or "/*...*/" from the reverse form to set the
	     description in the model.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Reverse 2.0.3</b><br />
	     Previous releases produced a syntax error when
	     the visibility is not specified in an inheritance,
	     fixed (default visibility is <i>private</i>).
	     Add management of <i>${description}</i><br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.0.3</b><br />
	     <b>Java Generator 2.0.1</b><br />
	     <b>Java Catalog 2.0.3</b><br />

	     <b>Idl Generator 2.0.1</b><br />
	     <b>Html Generator 2.1.1</b><br />
	     Add management of <i>${description}</i></li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.5.3</h3>September, 4th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Drag and drop inside the browser may produced an
	     infinite loop when an item is finally not moved (placed
	     under itself), fixed.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.5.2</h3>August, 24th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> <b>C++ Reverse 2.0.2</b><br />
	     Fixe bugs.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.5.1</h3>August, 21th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> The API with the <i>Plug-outs</i> is extended to 
	     manage the <i>states</i>.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Html documentation Generator 2.1</b><br />
             Updated to manage the <i>states</i>, must not be used with
	     the previous releases of BOUML.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <i>Plug-out</i> <b>empty</b><br />
             Updated to manage the <i>states</i>, must not be used with
	     the previous releases of BOUML.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Plug-out upgrade 1.0</b><br />
             This is a new <i>plug-out</i>, its goal is to upgrade
	     the (old) <i>plug-outs</i> not made from the last up to
	     date version of the <i>plug-out empty</i>, adding the
	     missing features.<br />
	     It is applied through the entry <i>plug-out upgrade</i> of
	     the menu <i>Tools</i> (this entry doesn't appears while a
	     dialog is opened or when the project is not a
	     <i>plug-out</i>).<br />
	     This first release add the management of the <i>states</i>
	     and associated features.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.0.2</b><br />
	     Remove a wrong check concerning inheritance.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.5</h3>August, 9th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Add <i>state actions</i> (<img src="doc/figs/stateaction.png" alt="" border="0" />,
	     <img src="doc/figs/statesendsignal.png" alt="" border="0" /> and 
	     <img src="doc/figs/statereceivesignal.png" alt="" border="0" />).<br /><br /></li>

	<li> It was not possible to drag nested classes from the browser
	     into a sequence or collaboration or use case diagram. Fixed<br /><br /></li>

	<li> This the previous releases, when you try to open a sequence
	     diagram you may have the error message <font color="red">
	     'end' expected rather than 'show_full_operations_definition'
	     </font> and a part of the diagram is not load. Fixed<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,
	     the previous releases of BOUML cannot read a project
	     saved with this version. Obviously this release is
	     able to read the projects made by previous releases of BOUML.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.4.1</h3>August, 5th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Old releases of BOUML crash when you add a message
	     in a <i>sequence diagram</i> from a <i>life line</i>
	     to a <i>class instance</i> (this is forbidden : the
	     target must be a <i>life line</i> or a <i>duration bar</i>)
	     because the check was incomplete, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Reverse 2.0.1</b><br />
	     <b>Java Reverse 2.0.2</b><br />
	     <b>Java Catalog 2.0.2</b><br />
             Fixe a bug on the concatenation of the comments
	     during the reverses</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.4</h3>July, 31th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Add <i>state regions</i>. Note : the regions are
	     not visible as long as the drawing of the <i>state</i>
	     is not enough increased<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Now, when you move or resize a <i>state</i> in a 
	     <i>state diagram</i>, the position of its <i>sub states</i>
	     is updated<br /><br /></li>

	<li> The new sub-menu <i>Diagram default format</i> of the
	     <i>Miscellaneous</i> menu allows to set the default format
	     of the diagrams (Iso A2/A3/A4/A5, or US A/B/C)<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,
	     the previous releases of BOUML cannot read a project
	     saved with this version. Obviously this release is
	     able to read the projects made by previous releases of BOUML.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.3.2</h3>July, 24th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> To save the project is not allowed when a least a dialog
	     is opened. Now a message box is shown when the shortcut
	     <i>Control-s</i> is hit or the project's menu is asked
	     but a dialog is opened.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Add the entry <i>save visible picture part</i>
	     near <i>copy visible picture part</i> in the diagram's
	     menu. This one allows to chooze a file to save the visible
	     part of the diagram using the PNG format.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Rename column from "*" to "do" in some dialogs hopping this
	     is more visible, because some people ask me to know how
	     to remove operation's parameter etc...<br /><br /></li>

	<li> The optional environment variable <i>BOUML_LIMIT_DESKTOP</i>
	     allows to specify a sub-part of all the desktop, its value
	     must be <i>x0,y0,x1,y1</i> without any spaces, where
	     <i>x0,y0</i> specify the top-left corner and <i>x1,y1</i>
	     the bottom-right corner. These limits are taken into account
	     only for the <u>initial</u> size and position of the BOUML's
	     windows and when a dialog is opened, after that you are
	     able to go out of these limits up to the true desktop
	     limits. Usefull mainly for the users having a multiple
	     monitors (side by side) configuration, see the
	     the post <i>Bugs > Window placement and sizing (multiple monitors)</i>
	     on the <a href="http://bouml.free.fr/phpBB2/index.php" target="_blank">forum</a>
	     </li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.3.1</h3>July, 18th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> minor change on the way to set a diagram's item upper/lower
	     (see my respons for the post <i>Bugs > state diagrams</i>
	     on the <a href="http://bouml.free.fr/phpBB2/index.php" target="_blank">forum</a>)
	     </li>

    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.3</h3>July, 17th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Fixes concerning the colors in the sequences diagrams.
	     <font color="red">For the old release since the 2.2, editing the
	     drawing settings of a sequence diagram under Linux may
	     crash BOUML !</font><br /><br /></li>

	<li> Fixes in the <i>Java</i> definition of the <i>empty
	     plug-out</i><br /><br /></li>

	<li> After a <i>cut here</i> made on a <i>duration bar</i> in a
	     <i>sequence diagram</i>, the color of the new <i>duration bar</i>
	     was not set, fixed<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Add <i>behavioral state machine</i>. Still on going, must be
	     done : to add <i>region</i>, to update <i>empty plug-out</i>
	     to access to the <i>states</i>. <i>Activity diagrams</i>
	     will be added too.<br />
	     <ul>
		<li>A <i>state machine</i> is a <i>state</i> defined under a
		<i>class view</i>, by default it has the stereotype
		<i>machine</i>, these are only differences with the other
		<i>states</i>.</li>
	
		<li>A <i>sub machine</i> is a <i>state</i> having
		the stereotype <i>submachine</i>, this is only
		difference with the other <i>states</i>. Theorycally
		a <i>sub machine</i> is defined under a <i>machine</i>,
		but BOUML doesn't check the usage of the stereotypes.</li>

		<li>Any <i>state</i> may contain sub <i>states, pseudo
		states, transitions</i> and <i>state diagram</i>.</li>

		<li>When you add a <i>state</i> or a <i>pseudo state</i>
		in a diagram out of any drawing <i>state</i>, the new
		one is added to the <i>state</i> containing the diagram.
		So in the <a href="http://bouml.free.fr/doc/figs/state1.png" target="_blank">example</a>
		it is useless to draw the <i>state machine ReadAmount</i>
		to add <i>sub states</i> and <i>pseudo states</i>.</li>

		<li>An <a href="http://bouml.free.fr/doc/figs/state1.png" target="_blank">example</a>
		of a <i>state machine</i> and a <i>state diagram</i>
		is given in the screenshots.</li>
	      </ul>
	      </li>

	<li> In the dialog's <i>User tab</i> the value is now
	     edited through a multiline editor<br /><br /></li>

	<li> On the diagrams the keyboard's arrows <i>Up, Down, Left</i>
	     and <i>right</i> move the selected items.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Html documentation Generator 2.0.1</b><br />
             ask for to remove or not all the already existing HTML
	     files in the target directory prior to generate the new ones<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 2.0.1</b><br />
             old releases crash on an empty <i>enum</i>, fixed<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,
	     the previous releases of BOUML cannot read a project
	     saved with this version. Obviously this release is
	     able to read the projects made by previous releases of BOUML.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.2.2</h3>June, 15th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> This release only exist for the <b>Linux</b> distribution,
	     some users have compilation problem associated with the
	     files <i>Labeled.h, JavaCatWindow.cpp</i> and
	     <i>UmlWindow.cpp</i>, fixed</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.2.1</h3>June, 8th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Depending on your configuration the encoding of the
	     accentued characters in the BOUML files could be wrong.
	     Fixed<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Documentation still referred <i>components</i> rather
	     than <i>artifacts</i>, fixed</li>

    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.2</h3>June, 5th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Add <i>fragments</i> (<img src="doc/figs/fragment.png" alt="" border="0" />),
	     available in all the diagrams.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Add <i>continuations</i> (<img src="doc/figs/continuation.png" alt="" border="0" />),
	     available in the <i>sequence diagrams</i>.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,
	     the previous releases of BOUML cannot read a project
	     saved with this version. Obviously this release is
	     able to read the projects made by previous releases of BOUML.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Java Reverse 2.0.1</b><br />
	     <b>Java Catalog 2.0.1</b><br />
		Fixe the same bug in these two <i>plug-outs</i></li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.1</h3>June, 2th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> It is not still possible to draw <i>association</i> between
	     <i>components</i>, the already defined ones are removed,
	     the right way is to use <i>dependency</i>.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Improve the <i>component</i>'s <i>drawing settings</i>
	     to allows to write the <i>component</i>'s compartments
	     (<i>required</i> and <i>provided interfaces</i> and the
	     <i>realizations</i>), for the <i>components</i> not drawn 
	     as an icon.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,
	     the previous releases of BOUML cannot read a project
	     saved with this version. Obviously this release is
	     able to read the projects made by previous releases of BOUML.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>2.0</h3>May, 23th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> First version associated to <b>UML 2.0</b>.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <font color="green"><u>The sources, libraries and executables, are now supported by
	     <i>artifacts</i> rather than <i>Components</i></u>.</font> The behavior of an
	     <i>artifact</i> is exactly the behavior which a <i>component</i> had.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> I suppose that all the components previously defined are used to produce
	     sources, libraries or executables, so :

	     <ul>
		<li> <font color="green">
		     When you load a project saved with a release less or
	     	     equal to <b>1.5.1</b>, all the <i>components</i> become <i>artifacts</i>,
	     	     all the <i>component views</i> become <i>deployment views</i> and
	     	     all the <i>component diagrams</i> become <i>deployment diagrams</i>.
	     	     </font></li>

		<li> <font color="green">
		     Furthermore, in case this project is a <i>plug out</i>, the
		     <i>UmlBaseComponent</i> class is modified with its members to
		     become the <i>UmlBaseArtifact</i> class, and the
		     <i>UmlComponent</i> class is modified to become the <i>UmlArtifact</i>
		     class updating <u>only</u> its default members. New
		     <i>UmlBaseComponent</i> and <i>UmlComponent</i> classes are created.</font>
		     Obviously this may be not enough and you should have to do manually
		     some additional changes. The modified <i>plug out</i> doesn't allow
		     to fully manage <i>components</i>, for that you have to create a new
		     <i>plug out</i> from the new definition of the <i>plug out</i> named 
		     <i>empty</i>.</li>

		<li> BOUML force a <i>save as</i>, then the project is closed.</li>
	     </ul>
	     </li>

	<li> The only way to have <i>components, component views</i> and
	     <i>component diagrams</i> is to create new ones.<br /><br /></li>
	     
	<li> A new <i>drawing setting</i> is added allowing to drawn the components
	     as an icon (old drawing) or following the <b>UML 2.0</b> specifications.
	     Nethertheless when a component not drawn as an icon has a stereotype, this
	     least is written rather than &lt;&lt;<i>component</i>&gt;&gt;
	     the same rule is followed for the <i>artifacts</i>. The non icon drawing
	     is resizeable.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> The drawing of the <i>required</i> and <i>provided interfaces</i>
	     doesn't follow exactly the <b>UML 2.0</b> specifications : to minimize
	     the number of labels, the <i>interface</i>'s name is attached to the line
	     termination rather than to the line(s).<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,
	     the previous releases of BOUML cannot read a project
	     saved with this version. Obviously this release is
	     able to read the projects made by previous releases of BOUML.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>1.5.1</h3>May, 11th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Fixe a bug on the duration color saving.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In case you can't reload a project because you have the
	     error <font color="red">...expected rather than 'duration' 
	     </font>, acknowledge the message and exit from BOUML,
	     edit the specified file at the given line with any text editor and
	     replace <i>duration</i> by
	     <i>duration_color</i>. Retry : the same error may exist
	     several times.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>1.5</h3>May, 5th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> The deletion of the labels in the diagrams is not
	     possible any more.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Update the window title when the corresponding diagram
	     is renamed.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>1.4.10</h3>April, 24th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Do not re-open diagrams modified then closed to save
	     them, to decrease saving time.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>1.4.9</h3>April, 23th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> <font color="red">Release <b>1.4.5</b> up to <b>1.4.7</b>
	     may crash under Windows due to a C++ compiler bug in
	     <i>optimize speed</i> mode.</font> Bypassed by having
	     one operation compiled with <i>optimize speed off</i>.
		<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Release <b>1.4.5</b> up to <b>1.4.8</b>
	     doesn't save <i>link</i> and <i>self link</i> of the
	     <i>collaboration diagram</i>. Fixed</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>1.4.8</h3>April, 17th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Release <b>1.4.5</b> up to <b>1.4.7</b>
	     may crash under Windows due to a C++ compiler bug. 
	     This delivery contains the <i>debug</i> version of BOUML
	     to mask the bug, because I do not have time to understand
	     what is append until the next week end, for professional
	     reasons.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Reverse 1.0.3</b><br />
		Adds management of Q_EXPORT, QM_EXPORT,
		etc... present into Qt definition.
		Little fixings.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>1.4.7</h3>April, 10th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Remove the management of the font associated to the screen
	     size introduced in the 1.4.5, because this is required by a
	     user.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Add a progress bar appearing when a saving need time</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>1.4.6</h3>April, 7th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> New <i>drawing settings</i> dialog, using <i>tabs</i>
	     to reduce its size.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>1.4.5</h3>April, 6th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Add <i>copy</i>/<i>cut</i>/<i>paste</i> commands for
	     the diagrams. A <i>paste</i> is only possible in a
	     diagram whose type is the one of the diagram where the
	     <i>copy</i>/<i>cut</i> was made. The shortcuts are
	     <i>Control c</i> for <i>copy</i>, 
	     <i>Control x</i> for <i>cut</i> and 
	     <i>Control v</i> for <i>paste</i>.
	     The <i>cut</i> is equivalent to a <i>copy</i> followed
	     by a remove from view, this means that the corresponding
	     browser items are not deleted.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Little modification to compute the default size of the
	     <i>generation settings</i> dialog.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> In case the default font point size is greater than 10
	     and the screen width is lower or equal to 1024 or its
	     height is lower or equal to 768, the default font point
	     size is set to 10.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>1.4.4</h3>April, 3th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Decrease the size of the <i>drawing settings</i> dialogs.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> The API base packages was read only. Now when the
	     associated file is writable, all may be changed except
	     the name. This allows to change the namespace/package/module
	     or the directories where the code generation are made.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Add diagram's element alignement, the reference is the
	     first selected element.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Fixe a bug concerning the <i>undo changes</i> in a diagram
	     and on the a bi-directional relation's <i>role b</i>
	     drawing in a diagram.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>1.4.3</h3>March, 31th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> <b>import Rose 1.1.2</b><br />
		Manage the <i>components</i>, note that the Rose tree of
		<i>components</i> is not reproduced because the
		<i>components</i> are too differents under Rose and BOUML,
		and because BOUML recommends to place each <i>component
		view</i> near the corresponding <i>class view</i><br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>Html generator 1.1</b><br />
		Ask for the directory where the <i>html</i> and <i>pgn</i> files
		will be produced rather than use a directory under <i>/tmp</i></li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>1.4.2</h3>March, 28th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Drag and Drop from the browser to a diagram forgot to
	     map viewport position to content position due to
	     scrollbars position, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Change positionning of the relation's role name and
	     multiplicity (correct it for a quarter of turn) in the
	     diagrams.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>1.4.1</h3>March, 23th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> <b>C++ Reverse 1.0.2</b><br />
		oupsss, C++ reverse loops on the first reversed file,
		fixed.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>1.4</h3>March, 22th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Through the <i>miscellaneous</i> menu the size of the base font
	     used for the browser and the diagrams may be specified.
	     Note that sometimes changing the size does nothing because
	     the desired font is not available. A had introduced this
	     feature mainly because the default size under Linux and
	     Windows is not the same, this may change the relative
	     position of the objects and a relation drawn vertically
	     with one font will be inclined with an other.
	     This size is memorized in the file memorizing the project,
	     but I allow to change the font size even when the file
	     is read only (the new font size can't be saved).<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,
	     the previous releases of BOUML cannot read a project
	     saved with this version. Obviously this release is
	     able to read the projects made by previous releases of BOUML.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>1.3.2</h3>March, 20th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Now all the sequence diagram items may be placed upper/lower.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>1.3.1</h3>March, 16th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> <b>import Rose 1.1.1</b><br />
		little change</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>1.3</h3>March, 13th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> <font color="red">Release 1.1 &amp; 1.2 contains a major bug
	     linked to the diagrams saving</font>, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Add import of a bouml project into a package.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Under Windows the <i>optimal window size</i> command may
	     produce an infinite resizing loop, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,
	     the previous releases of BOUML cannot read a project
	     saved with this version. Obviously this release is
	     able to read the projects made by previous releases of BOUML.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>1.2</h3>March, 8th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> <b>import Rose 1.1</b><br />
		correction when a file path is specified through
		a variable ($var form into the rose model files)</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />

<h3>1.1</h3>March, 6th 2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
	<li> Now the identifier of an item in a diagram is fixed and
	     the order of the item definitions is also fixed in the
	     *.diagram generated files. This may help to merge diagram
	     files !<br /><br /></li>

	<li> <b>C++ Generator 1.1</b><br />
		C++ Generated code was wrong in case a referenced class is
		nested in an other one or sometimes when it is defined
		in an other namespace, fixed.<br />
		C++ Generated code for a friend to a template class was
		wrong, fixed.<br /><br /></li>

	<li> Because the format of the BOUML files is changed,
	     the previous releases of BOUML cannot read a project
	     saved with this version. Obviously this release is
	     able to read the projects made by previous release of BOUML.</li>
    </ul>
<br /><br />
